> SINGAPORE: A former Head of Department for English at Woodgrove Secondary School will begin her jail term for taking S$40,000 in student funds after losing an appeal on Friday (Aug 12).

> A High Court judge dismissed the appeal by Maslinda Zainal against her conviction and upheld her sentence of one-and-a-half years' jail.

> Maslinda, 47, was found guilty of two counts of criminal breach of trust as a public servant last year, after rounds of court hearings where all 20 teachers in the English department testified.

> She was in charge of collecting money that students submitted to their teachers for learning packages, but over-collected about S$40,000 between January 2016 and April 2017.

> The school's lower-secondary head for English discovered the offences when she checked the amounts collected against the bookshop invoices and found discrepancies.

> Maslinda admitted in police statements that she found it troublesome to return the surplus to students, and said that she used it to buy stationery and other items for them.

> She later testified that the police pressed her to confess. But Justice Chua Lee Ming found no reason to disagree with the trial judge's finding that she gave the statements voluntarily.

> In the appeal, Maslinda challenged the amount of student funds that she was found guilty of taking.

> Justice Chua rejected her arguments, saying that the trial judge's findings ""cannot be said to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, save for a small reduction of S$12"".

> He said that the amount collected from the students was proven through their book lists, class lists and evidence from teachers, while the amount paid for the learning packages was evidenced by the bookshop invoices.

> But he allowed a reduction of S$12 from the amount collected based on the evidence of a teacher who collected the money from the students.

> SINGAPORE: Parents’ dialect groups will be included in digital birth certificates issued from Sep 1, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Friday (Aug 12).

> This comes after ICA received several queries regarding the exclusion of this information.

> Parents’ dialect groups were among the fields of information that were left out during the transition from physical to digital birth certificates. These fields of information were dropped as they were “not necessary for policy and other administrative needs”, ICA said.

> Other fields of information excluded are: The parents’ countries of birth, the mother’s address, the child’s place of birth registration and a section called “Informant’s Particulars”.

> This was done “to simplify the registration process, and to reduce the number of fields” the authority added.

> Information about parents’ dialect groups continues to be registered by ICA, said the authority, adding that it is available in Singpass. However, ICA acknowledged “the feelings that have been expressed on the matter”.

> “We have therefore decided to include parents’ dialect in digital birth certificates issued from Sep 1, 2022,” ICA said.

>Borrowing costs are climbing in almost every economy and global growth is losing altitude. That’s a familiar message to central bank watchers, though few heads of government have laid the shift out as starkly to the citizenry. Even in the annals of monetary policy, the BOE’s pronouncement days before Lee’s remarks was startling: A long recession will begin soon, unemployment will go up and inflation will remain elevated. Don’t look for rate cuts to alleviate the downturn. “To our knowledge, no central bank has ever published as negative an economic forecast (relative to the private sector consensus) as the Bank of England’s latest,” Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a report Monday.

>Inflation in Singapore is low relative to many advanced economies at 4.4%, excluding private transport and accommodation. It’s nevertheless accelerating; June’s reading was the highest in almost 14 years. The Monetary Authority of Singapore reckons inflation will peak next quarter, before easing toward the end of the year. Given the experience of most central banks who were surprised by the force of price increases, it would be unwise to bet the house on that. Policy has been tightened four times, beginning last year, and economists foresee the MAS tapping the brakes at least once more.

>The core level inflation obscures some of the pain most households feel. The all-items consumer price index climbed 6.7%, quicker than most economists had forecast. “I know the cost of living is at the top of everyone’s minds,” Lee said. Residents are wrestling with spikes in electricity charges, contending with big jumps in rent, moaning about the cost of taxis and ride-hailing services and spiraling costs of home renovations. Singapore, which is about half the size of Maui, imports much of what is consumed on the island.

>The march of inflation has been accompanied by eroding growth. Gross domestic product shrank last quarter from the prior three months, the government reported Thursday; economists had forecast a small increase. The government cut its full-year projection to growth of between 3% to 4%, down from 3% to 5%. As with the US, the labor market simultaneously remains pretty warm. At conferences and business gatherings, executives frequently complain about the lengths rivals will go to in poaching staff, even waiting outside bathrooms to make a pitch to employees on their way back from a break.

>Another issue Singapore, and Southeast Asia, needs to adjust to is the less rosy economic conditions in China. The decades that Lee put in the rear-view mirror were also characterized by a China that surged after its entrance to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and propped up the region with a costly stimulus program in 2008. Since then, it’s been on a gentle glide down to a more sustainable, but still enviable, pace of growth. The Covid era has brought a rude awakening. Beijing’s expansion won’t always be as sluggish as the second quarter’s 0.4%, let alone the contraction at the start of 2020. But it faces a banking and real estate crisis, an aging population and the economic fallout of heightened tensions with the US.

Fiscal measures can also alleviate inflation’s bite; Lee foreshadowed more steps in that direction. But a series of shocks adds up to an environment much less conducive to the success of small global financial hubs. The power of Singapore’s mighty public sector can be a cushion to absorb change: From aviation, banking, healthcare and daycare to supermarkets and convenience stores, the reach of the state and its partners is enormous. That’s useful for resilience in times of crisis. If the new normal calls for nimbleness, Singapore may have its work cut out.

So what are they doing to prepare for the coming downturn? There seems to be no concrete plans or efforts. If we’re just going to coast on global trade growth all the time then what’s the point in having a Govt at all?

> SINGAPORE - The first rehearsal for the National Day Parade (NDP) show with all the different groups of performers was a mini-disaster that nearly went up in flames, said its creative director Adrian Pang.

> Things that were not supposed to catch fire did, he said.

> ""I was horrified. Watching that first rehearsal was a big kick in the gut and slap in the face,"" he added.

> ""But really, I think the first time you see it, it has to horrify you, just for you to know how much work you need to do to fix things.""

> Directing the show for the first time, he wanted to throw a ""birthday bash"" for the nation, by tying ""millions of different stories into one thread"", but soon found that he could not give voice to all Singaporeans, or please everyone.

> When he was approached last year to direct the NDP show, Mr Pang was ""very amused"".

> ""I was persuaded that I had to at least try it out once,"" he said.

> But he soon changed his mind as he cast about for ideas and hit upon a dark period in his life.

> Mr Pang got emotional during the interview as he recounted how his family had helped him get through a months-long deep depression at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

> ""It was a really, really tough time. I really didn't see it coming. My family saw me through it, they lifted me up and kept my head above water.

> ""And I know I had it easy, compared to many, many other people. I still had a home to be safe and I had a loving family. I was able to keep Pangdemonium (his theatre company) intact somehow.

> ""I know many, many people, many of my colleagues who had to resort to quite desperate measures just to get by. People's lives have been changed, irrevocably.""

> That inspired him to put together a show about gratitude.

> SINGAPORE - Two new groups of homeless persons emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic, a study on the state of homelessness in Singapore has found.

> The first group comprises those who never slept on the streets before the pandemic but lost their jobs when Covid-19 struck and could not pay rent for a room on the open market.

> The others in this group include those whose friends or relatives gave them shelter but had to leave those homes for reasons such as fear that the homeless person's stay would contravene the ban on social visits during the circuit breaker period.

> This group includes both men and women, whose ages span the 30s to the 70s.

> The second group is made up of mostly middle-aged Singaporean men who are wed to a Malaysian or Indonesian and they live in those countries but commute to Singapore for better-paying jobs here.

> When the borders closed and a host of travel restrictions were imposed, they suddenly found themselves unable to travel back to Johor Bahru or Batam and had to sleep on the streets here.

> The study is done by Dr Ng Kok Hoe, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy who led a team of researchers at the school's Social Inclusion Project to do the second nationwide street count of the homeless here.

> Besides counting the number of homeless persons on the streets, the study involved in-depth interviews with 51 such individuals staying at a temporary shelter. Dr Ng said the study is the first local one of its kind here.

> Besides the two groups of homeless people, there is also the third group comprising those who have been homeless even before the pandemic upended lives and livelihoods.

> These long-term homeless persons have been on the streets from a few months to up to 25 years, and there are more men than women in this group. Their ages range from the 30s to the 70s.

> The report said of this group, whose members live in ""extreme poverty"": ""Participants (those interviewed) described being hungry and having to find protection from the rain and the cold.

> ""There were accounts of skipping meals for several days at a time, depending on generous passers-by to provide food, getting free meals from temples and mosques and eating leftovers.""

> There are common factors that contribute to homelessness for the three groups, the report said.

> Many work in low-wage jobs, earning about $1,000 a month. For some, their poor physical or mental health prevent them from being employed or working regularly.

> SINGAPORE - Tax collection here rose by $11.1 billion, or 22.4 per cent, in the last financial year compared with the previous year.

> The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) said on Thursday (Aug 11) that total tax collection amounted to $60.7 billion, representing 73.6 per cent of the Government's operating revenue and 11.4 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product.

> Corporate income tax made up the largest share of Iras' collection at $18.2 billion, or 30 per cent. This was followed by individual income tax at $14.2 billion, of which about 80 per cent came from taxpayers with an annual income of above $150,000.

> Goods and services tax made up $12.6 billion and stamp duty totalled $6.8 billion.

> Of the $11.1 billion rise in tax collection in the last financial year compared with the year before, stamp duty comprised the largest share at $2.9 billion due to the buoyant property market and an increase in property transactions.

> This was followed by GST at $2.3 billion due to higher consumption as Covid-19 restrictions were eased and the economy rebounded.

> Stamp duty collection, which is dependent on the volume and value of transactions, may vary from year to year. Over a five-year period, stamp duty collection grew by an average of 8.4 per cent on a compounded annual basis.

> Iras said the increase in corporate income tax ($2.1 billion) and individual income tax ($1.4 billion) reflected stronger earnings as well as the deferment of tax payments in the last financial year to help businesses cope with the impact of Covid-19.

> The tax collected in the previous financial year was $49.6 billion, 7.3 per cent lower than the $53.5 billion for the year before because of the pandemic, said Iras.

> Recovery for tax collection was seen across all tax types in the last financial year as Singapore's economy rebounded following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.

> The arrears rate for income tax, GST and property tax fell to 0.6 per cent at $332.8 million for the last financial year, compared with 0.72 per cent in the year before.

> Beyond tax collection, Iras continued to disburse enterprise grants on behalf of the Government to support businesses, jobs and wage growth for Singaporeans.

> In the last financial year, Iras disbursed a total of $8.2 billion under various schemes including the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS), Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), Jobs Growth Incentive and Rental Support Scheme.

> For example, there was $840 million in WCS payouts to more than 99,000 employers on qualifying wage increases and $3.1 billion in payouts to over 130,000 businesses under the JSS.

> Meanwhile, Iras continues to achieve a high taxpayer satisfaction rate of 98 per cent in the 2021 Taxpayer Survey. Its digital services have been enhanced to enable taxpayers to transact conveniently with Iras. This has significantly reduced the number of taxpayers requiring assisted services, said Iras.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore has trimmed its growth forecast for 2022, as the global economic environment weakens further amid challenges such as inflation and persistent supply chain disruptions.

> The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Thursday (Aug 11) that the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for this year is now expected to come in between 3 and 4 per cent, narrowing from the previous 3 to 5 per cent range.

> Policymakers had warned in May that growth would likely come in at the lower half of the 3 to 5 per cent forecast range for this year.

> MTI said the global economic environment has “deteriorated further” since its last assessment in May.

> Stronger than-expected inflationary pressures and aggressive monetary policy tightening by central banks are set to weigh on growth in major advanced economies, such as the United States and Eurozone.

> China continues to grapple with a deepening property market downturn and recurring domestic COVID-19 outbreaks; and supply chain disruptions are likely to persist for the rest of the year given how factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and China’s zero-COVID policy remain.

> “The external demand outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened compared to three months ago,” MTI said in its report.

> Meanwhile, downside risks in the global economy remain “significant”.

> These include the possibility of further escalations in the Ukraine war, disorderly market adjustments to monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, an escalation in regional geopolitical tensions and the trajectory of the COVID‐19 pandemic.

> This means that the outlook for some outward-oriented sectors in Singapore has dimmed, said MTI.

> For instance, the growth prospects of Singapore’s chemicals cluster and the fuels and chemicals segment of the wholesale trade sector have been adversely affected by the weakening economic outlook in China, which is a key market for petroleum and chemicals products from Singapore.

> Growth in the water transport and finance and insurance sectors is also expected to be dampened by the projected slowdown in major external economies.

> On the other hand, Singapore has transited to living with COVID-19 with the progressive removal of nearly all domestic and border restrictions. This has in turn supported the recovery of some segments of the economy, such as aviation- and tourism-related sectors.

> SINGAPORE - A tow truck driver died on Aug 3 after he was pinned between a bus and a pillar at a private transport interchange in Kranji.

> This takes the total number of work-related deaths in Singapore this year to 32.

> In response to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the worker, a Chinese national aged 43, was guiding the bus into position next to a pillar at the interchange located at 60 Jalan Lam Huat, the address for mega auto facility Carros Centre.

> The accident took place at about 11am.

> According to an alert issued by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council on Wednesday (Aug 10), the worker was standing next to the pillar while guiding the bus, which was reversing into what appears to be a bus parking space at the interchange occupied by ComfortDelGro Bus.

> After reversing, the driver of the bus moved the vehicle forward to reposition it, but this led to the worker being crushed, said the WSH Council.

> The worker was employed by Singapore Towing Equipments. He was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, where he died, MOM said.

> The ministry is investigating the accident, and said it has instructed Singapore Towing Equipments to stop all towing of vehicles from non-public roads and buildings.

> Said MOM: ""As a general safety measure, when guiding the movement of vehicles in tight spaces, employers and supervisors should carry out safety assessments and communicate safety pointers clearly to the workers performing the task.

> ""They should also put in place a traffic management plan, with clearly demarcated parking areas and management of blind spots using convex mirrors, road humps and signage.""

> When contacted, a manager at Singapore Towing Equipments, who declined to be named, said the worker who died was an experienced tow truck driver who joined the company in February.

> The manager also said he is not exactly sure what had happened, adding that he has not been given the full details by the authorities.

> The Straits Times has also asked ComfortDelGro for comments on the accident.

> SINGAPORE - After more than two weeks since the last industrywide price reduction, fuel pump prices here are on the slide again.

> Esso, which sparked the last price cut, started the ball rolling on Wednesday (Aug 10) afternoon by bringing pump prices to their lowest since February.

> According to Fuel Kaki, a petrol and diesel price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, Esso's posted diesel price is now 11 cents lower at $2.81, while its three petrol grades are nine cents lower.

> Esso's 92-octane petrol is now $2.80 a litre, while its 95- and 98-octane fuels are $2.85 and $3.32 respectively.

> After discount, Esso offers the lowest petrol price with its 92-octane at $2.30 a litre (with DBS Esso card).

> For 95-octane, Sinopec, which has only three stations here, has the lowest price at $2.30 (with OCBC cards). Among bigger network operators, Esso's $2.34 is the lowest (with DBS Esso card).

> For 98-octane, Sinopec's offer of $2.68 (with OCBC cards) is the lowest, followed by Esso's $2.72 (with DBS Esso card).

> Esso's aggressive price cuts follow a continuing downward movement in prices of crude oil and refined products. Rising inflation is putting a dent in demand on both automotive and non-automotive fronts.

> Brent crude last closed on Nasdaq at US$96.65 a barrel, its lowest since February. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, is US$2.95 a gallon, also at its lowest since February.

> Esso's price reduction on Wednesday is likely to trigger price cuts by other pump operators here.

> According to the Economic Development Board (EDB), the Distinguished Friends of Singapore award, initiated by EDB in 1998, is the highest form of national recognition for non-Singaporeans who have made ""significant contributions"" to the country's economic growth.

> In a memo sent to his staff, Dyson, the fonder of the multinational tech company that specialises in household appliances, thanked the government for its support, and said the award is ""a great honour and recognition"" of the Dyson team in Singapore.

> He also credited ""wonderful"" engineers and scientists from Singapore who are driving ""exciting research programmes"" with the country's universities, along with the country's emphasis on STEM education and tech development, as the reason why Singapore is a ""supportive environment"" for a high-tech manufacturer like Dyson.

> According to the Prime Minister's Office, Dyson was among the four foreign business leaders who were conferred a Public Service Award.

> The other three were Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg who's on the Temasek International Panel, Shimano Yozo, Singapore's Honorary Consul-General in Osaka, and Bill Winters, the Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered Bank.

> A total of 67 individuals received the award for their contributions to Singapore.

> SINGAPORE: A 37-year-old man was sentenced to jail for a year and nine months on Wednesday (Aug 10) for assaulting his sister and his wife.

> He cannot be named as the identity of his victims is protected by gag order.

> The court heard that on Jun 9, 2020, the man slapped and punched his sister when she visited their mother at home. The offender was drinking heavily at the time.

> The victim was talking to another sibling about selling their mother's house when the offender started scolding and questioning her.

> When she refused to answer him, he slapped her. He also pushed her, causing the back of her head to hit the wall.

> The man got angrier when his sister continued not to reply. He slapped her, punched her face repeatedly and strangled her. She started to drift in and out of consciousness due to the severity of the blows.

> When she regained consciousness, her brother told her to perform a sex act on him. She struggled but was overpowered.

> He then squeezed his sister's chest and pulled her shirt, exposing her. He told her ""he could sleep with her or bring her to Geylang to sell her body"", court documents stated.

> The man threatened to assault anyone who tried to intervene and told his family not to call the police.

> At around 10pm, about three hours after the victim first arrived at the house, one of their siblings managed to leave the house and call emergency services.

> The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a nasal fracture, blunt trauma to her eye and a contusion at her chest.

> ASSAULTED WIFE MULTIPLE TIMES

> The man also admitted to assaulting his wife on three occasions in May 2021.

> In one incident, the offender's wife was using her phone when he accused her of hiding something from him.

> He hurled vulgarities, punched and kicked her face multiple times and pulled her hair and shirt. A friend who was with them called the police.

> Although the victim had a cut on her lip, she refused medical attention as she was worried that her husband would assault her again if she pursued the matter.

> Later that month, the couple got into a dispute in the wife's flat. The man hit her head multiple times with a hard glass bottle of deodorant, causing her to bleed.

> He also hit her arms and legs many times with an object that was stated in court documents as ""black cylindrical equipment"".

> The victim did not tell anyone about the assault as she was afraid of her husband.

> Two days later, the man went to his mother's flat where he started assaulting his wife again. He punched her eye, hit her head multiple times and threw hard objects at her.

> The victim made a police report the next day and sought medical assistance for her injuries.

> At the time of these assaults, the man's wife had a personal protection order in force against him.

> The man pleaded guilty to one charge each of outrage of modesty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, causing hurt with a dangerous weapon and disorderly behaviour.

> He also admitted to two charges of breaching a personal protection order that his wife took out against him in 2018. Eleven other charges were considered for sentencing.

This is a project I'm doing in which I combine food native to a country with noodles, which I chose because I love them and noodles are versatile and easy to top things with. I eat the toppings first and then the noodles.

This isn't meant to offend anyone and I'm sorry if I make mistakes.

Americans don't actually eat like this, and neither do I usually, it's only for this project, I would normally just eat (most) things separately, but for this project I want it to be all together as toppings. I am also aware other people don't eat this way, it's just the format I've chosen for this project.

The reason for the watermark is that my content (this series specifically) has been stolen in the past.

I draw all of the flags myself and sometimes they are quite time consuming, but it's worth it because I love flags.

I'm doing every country, please be aware that this intended to be a fun project for me, meant to celebrate culinary diversity.

Sometimes I get things wrong, sometimes there either isn't enough information available or the information I find is incorrect. Sometimes one country's version of a dish is similar but different from neighbor country. Additionally, sometimes things get lost in translation, and sometimes I have to change up a recipe, put my own spin on it, or make substitutions for ingredients I can't find.

> “We would ask that everyone respects their privacy at this extremely difficult time. We want to be clear that we will absolutely not tolerate domestic abuse or violence in any form.

> “When incidents of this nature do occur we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.”

> Mr Fong’s guilty plea comes five days into the trial. Court proceedings were postponed last Thursday and Friday due to a lawyer's illness.

> Acting on behalf of the prosecution, Peter Makepeace QC told the court last week that Mr Fong and Ms Pek were in the UK following a trip to Dubai and Europe.

> They had planned to tour Scotland, but while on the Isle of Skye, a small island off the Scottish coast, Mr Fong experienced a bad fall.

> On a walk one evening, he tripped, lost his step in the dark and fell down a steep embankment.

> The court heard that an ambulance was called, and Mr Fong was given a mix of painkillers by paramedics before being taken to hospital to be examined.

> Days later, the couple travelled down to Newcastle with their son Alonzo Fong and checked into the Country Aparthotel on Westgate Road.

> The court played a recording of the call Alonzo made to the emergency services soon after 7am on Dec 6.

> He’s heard saying: “Okay, he told me, I think they had some argument of some sort and then I think he lost it. ""

> The court also heard from Dr Jennifer Bolton who carried out the post-mortem of Ms Pek’s body.

> The mother-of-three had been wearing black leggings, a black top and black underwear, stained with urine, when she was found.

> The forensic pathologist said 11 bruises and haemorrhages were visible on Ms Pek’s chin, shoulders, arms and legs.

> Two large, symmetrical bruises were identified on each shoulder, which Dr Bolton said she believed were likely to have been caused at the same time.

> She added: “That then raises the possibility of her being knelt on while the pillow was then held over her face.”

> Mr Fong took the stand himself on Monday, describing his marriage as “wonderful”, “peaceful” and “very happy”.

> When questioned by the prosecution, the defendant claimed he could not remember any details of killing his wife.

> He replied “I don’t know” or “I cannot remember” to most questions put to him.

Now I'm not a very emotional person by nature, and I know Singapore has a lot of problems, but I'll never forget NDP 2020 when they played all the NDP songs and the national anthem. Stuck in a room with no idea when I'd get to visit family or even step out again, I remember really breaking down and crying while watching the stream on my computer. I also remember breaking down when I landed back here once the borders opened.

Yes, Singapore has its own problems, some which are deeply rooted in the society that need to be worked on, and others that are political, but at the end of the day it is the land we've all grown from. I don't know whether this guy is a paid actor or not, but I know the feelings he's showing are ones which many Singaporeans have felt over the past few years, and I don't think it's all that bad if you find yourself breaking down over it.

> An e-commerce grocery app in Singapore has come under fire after it distributed promotional mailers to some households informing them of its new ""Goodwill Disbursement Credit vouchers"" or ""GDC"" vouchers.

> A HardwareZone user, who goes by the username CrucifyMyLove, took to the forum on Sunday (Aug. 7) to ask if anyone had also received the same letter.

> Though the letter looked very similar to those sent by the various Community Development Councils (CDCs) in October 2021 and May 2022, the user pointed out that getting asked to download the ""GaiGai Singapore App"" — an online supermarket — to redeem the vouchers seemed very strange.

> Misleading marketing

> Its letter stated that the disbursement of these ""GDC"" vouchers were to celebrate Singapore's 57th birthday, and to ""subsidise the recent increased cost of living"".

> To redeem these ""GDC"" vouchers, one has to download an app, and use the vouchers to offset part of their grocery purchases made via the app.

> People were quick to point out that the scheme may very likely be a scam — as the marketing materials were designed to look like they came from a government agency.

> They pointed out the misleading use of the Merlion in the letter, which may lead one to believe that the letter came from an official government source.

> And of course — the name ""GDC vouchers"", which could easily be mistaken for the official CDC vouchers that were disbursed to every Singaporean household.

> The format and style of the instructions on how to redeem the ""GDC"" vouchers were also very similar to CDC's materials.

> A mandarin version of the instruction sheet was included:

> For comparison, here is what the real CDC mailer looked like:

> And the logo and illustrations from the CDC voucher website:

> Police report allegedly made, e-commerce app apologies

> Many urged the user to report the letter to the police, convinced that it was a scam.

> The user subsequently provided an update to say they had made a police report and was in contact with the investigating officer of the case.

> At around midnight on Monday (Aug. 8), the e-commerce app responsible for the marketing campaign, GaiGai Singapore, released a statement apologising for the confusion that it caused.

> It clarified that the mailers, which were sent to residents in Hougang and Serangoon, were indeed sent by them and that they were a ""legitimate business registered in Singapore"".

> It reiterated that it was not affiliated with any government body, and did not represent any government agency.

> ""We acknowledged that our GDC Voucher marketing campaign has misled certain residents into thinking that we are associated to the Government and we deeply apologise for that matter,"" it added.

> It added that it had ""sincerely"" wanted to do its part to help ease inflationary pressures for Singaporeans, and that its S$55 vouchers were ""indeed legitimate"".

> ""Rest assured we are not scammers,"" it said.

> NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND - The 51-year-old Singaporean man accused of smothering his wife to death with a pillow accepts that he carried out the act but cannot remember doing it, a jury heard on Monday (Aug 8).

> Fong Soong Hert told Newcastle Crown Court that he has no recollection of the incident at County Aparthotel in Newcastle, in the early hours of Dec 6 last year.

> ""I don't remember, I really want to, I cannot explain,"" he said, later adding: ""I'm really desperate to understand what happened and what went wrong.""

> While giving his evidence on day four of the murder trial before Judge Paul Sloan QC, Fong said he had been in significant pain after a fall down a steep slope in Scotland days earlier. He described feeling like ""a walking corpse"", adding: ""I felt like my whole body is in pain, my bones will shatter, my head will explode with pain.""

> Fong said he was taking several medications to help manage severe discomfort.

> He also had prescription medications for anxiety, depression and to help him sleep.

> Junior defence counsel Steven Reed led the questioning by asking the defendant about his relationship with his wife of 28 years, Madam Pek Ying Ling, 51. Fong responded that it was ""wonderful - we were so happy"", adding that his marriage was ""never"" a cause of stress.

> When asked if they ever argued, he said: ""Definitely, yes, life is full of ups and downs and challenges. We have disagreements, we have arguments, bickerings."" But the arguments were never physical, he noted.

> The defendant added the bickering often came from his wife's side, when ""she wants my attention to get some things done, when I feel it's not so urgent"".

> Fong told the jury that he was usually the calmer one and often stepped away if things got heated. He added that he was not angry or resentful of his wife for the bickering.

> Reed explained to the court that the couple's holiday took them first to Dubai, Croatia, then Scotland, where they planned to spend a few days, before visiting Newcastle. While in the Isle of Skye, Fong had a fall, which he recalled to the court: ""I slipped or tripped on something while I was trying to take a picture. I went tumbling, rolling, free drop.""

> He ended up against a shed, but does not remember any other detail. Following the fall, he had pain in his arms, knees, legs, the lower back and spine area, and headaches. At a local hospital where he was given pain medication, he recalls a doctor saying that he was ""very, very fortunate"" that he had not suffered fatal injuries.

> Fong explained that the medication only worked temporarily - he could not sit, lie or stand for long and was having bad headaches. He said that his wife took responsibility for his medication and was helping him to take it. ""She looks after me very well"", he told the court.

> SINGAPORE - Travel takes the top spot in Singaporeans' spending priorities for non-essential items, with most willing to fund their expenses through instalment payment options such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) schemes, showed a recent survey.

> BNPL services generally allow consumers to spread out their payments at zero interest, but charge late fees. They take a cut from merchants for each sale.

> Analysts and industry players told The Straits Times that consumers are increasingly opting for such services because of their convenience.

> But some said safeguards need to be in place to protect users.

> A recent survey by travel tech company Amadeus found that 46 per cent of consumers said international travel is a priority area for spending in the coming year, much more than fashion, eating out and big-ticket items such as a new car.

> Eating out was important to 37 per cent of the 500 Singaporeans polled in June, while 29 per cent prioritised fashion purchases, and just 24 per cent wanted to spend on big-ticket items such as a new car or home furnishings.

> The respondents were aged 18 and above and had a range of income levels.

> The survey also found that Singaporeans have the most appetite for international travel, coming ahead of German, French and US consumers.

> A total of 4,500 consumers in France, Germany, Britain, the United States and Singapore were polled for the survey.

> Singaporean travellers are more likely to spread out their expenses to avoid high foreign exchange transaction fees and dip into loyalty points they previously collected, showed the survey.

> About 95 per cent said they might choose instalment options such as BNPL services to fund their travel over the coming year, topping the global average of 75 per cent.

> This figure also beats the 57 per cent of those polled here who said they might use a credit card.

> Ms Barbara Crane, KPMG in Singapore's financial services advisory partner, said the professional services firm is increasingly seeing companies offer BNPL options for travel purchases in addition to online or in-store ones.

I figured that we can do a r/Singapore beach clean up. I cant really organise this by myself so I found this environmentalist organisation. It a Christian environmentalist group that is going to have a beach cleaning activity on 27th August. I havé spoken to them and they seem like they are able to help out. I am currently also finding other organisations to do beach cleaning so It’s available for more people free on other dates.

Currently I just want to know the numbers of how many people want to join. Please DM me so I can get a rough estimate of numbers. The date approaching I will send a sign up link.

American will not relinquish its Pacific ring of influence, unless another Trump comes to power and actually removes US bases from the Asia Pacific. And China, like Japan before it, will only become more aggressive in its sphere of influence - as superpowers do. Let’s not forget that the US’ own Monroe Doctrine of keeping all foreign powers away from its backyard of Central America. 

Nominally, their interests do not clash to the extent that it’s a zero sum game - it’s irritating to China but I think, overall, having the US provide a security blanket to the Japanese at least dampens any nuclear arms race in the region. Taiwan is the real flashpoint. But as long as the US maintains its deliberate ambiguity and Taiwan pursues a policy of international outreach and soft power rather than demanding global recognition ….

ijglbtm,wjdge2,2vx2xcyw,"> # 'Doesn't really make a difference': Ang Mo Kio SERS residents shrug at chance to apply for BTO flat in the estate

> SINGAPORE: Residents at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 whose blocks were selected for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) have been offered the option to apply for a new flat at a BTO project at Ang Mo Kio Central, but some residents are not sold on the idea.

> Among those who spoke to CNA on Monday (Aug 8), some said the flats at the BTO site, which is said to be more accessible, would be pricier. Others were worried about whether they would forfeit their priority for a unit at the SERS replacement site next to ITE College Central, should they be unable to secure a BTO at Ang Mo Kio Central.

> Residents were informed of the new option in a letter via email on Aug 5.

> In the letter sent by the Housing and Development Board (HDB), which was seen by CNA, they were told that 10 per cent of the units at the Ang Mo Kio BTO site – Central Weave @ AMK – would be set aside for them.

> This 10 per cent priority allocation comes under the Resettlement/Relocation/Tenants’ Priority Scheme.

> Residents were also told that they could use their SERS rehousing benefits to apply for a flat at the Ang Mo Kio BTO site. The benefits include a SERS grant of S$30,000, if eligible, HDB said in response to CNA’s queries about the allocation of flats.

> HDB said in its letter that it extended the offer to them after some residents expressed interest in the Ang Mo Kio BTO project. It also noted that the project's (Delivery Possession Date (DPD) is estimated to be within 2029.

> The existing designated replacement site next to ITE College Central has a DPD no later than Mar 31, 2029.

> The DPD is the date by which HDB is legally required to hand over the keys to residents.

> Residents were also told they could enjoy the 10 per cent priority allocation quota and their SERS rehousing benefits at three other BTO projects in the upcoming August BTO exercise. These projects – Keat Hong Grange (Choa Chu Kang), Woodlands South Plains (Woodlands) and Sun Plaza Spring (Tampines) – were offered because they have the same DPD as the ITE College Central site.

> QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIORITY FOR REPLACEMENT SITE

> A 39-year-old resident who only wanted to be known as Lynn was concerned that flat prices at the Ang Mo Kio BTO site would be “much higher”.

> ""The Ang Mo Kio BTO site is very near to the MRT. Very convenient. The ITE College Central site is not so convenient although they said there are buses going to the MRT,” she noted.

> “And HDB only allocates 10 per cent (to us). But if we can’t get a flat there, when we want to go back to the ITE site, will we still be at the front of the queue?”

> Another resident, who gave his name as Crispin, shared the same concerns.

> “If I apply the BTO then never win, then I want to go back (to the ITE site), what is my status there? What if I apply for the BTO then no chance already for this (ITE site)? You need to be clear. Can you give (residents) the reassurance that if you lose, you still win?” said the 58-year-old who works in engineering.

> “I don’t want to gamble (on) this one, because at the end of the day, I might need to find a whole other house.”

> Regardless of the site, Crispin said he would still need to wait about five years for his new flat. “If you say I will get a new house next month, then okay, there is a difference,” he said.

Hi,

We’d like to firstly thank you for the support and faith you have put in us thus far, and we’d like to assure you that we’re here for the long run. 

It has come to our attention that recent anonymous accounts on Twitter and news articles have cast accusations against us with respect to our UST/Anchor exposure and yield generation strategies. We’d like to take this time to assure you that we did not take any losses as a firm but users on our platform who held UST did. We continue to stay solvent and we’ve not halted withdrawals due to the lack of liquidity, and speculations contrary to these are untrue. We do not take these unwarranted accusations lightly, and will be looking to explore legal recourse where appropriate. 

We would like to assure you that we are committed to building the business and toughing out the bear market. With our new launch for deposits & withdrawals via the Binance Smart Chain just yesterday, further development on our market-making expertise, we endeavour to get through this winter stronger than ever.
