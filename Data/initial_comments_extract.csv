> Six trains stalled and commuters on board got off safely at their nearest stations, said the transport operator.

> ""There was full lighting and ventilation in the stalled train while the commuters were on-board,"" said SMRT, adding that engineers have been deployed to fix the issue.

> Free regular and bridging bus services have been activated. In a tweet, SMRT advised passengers to travel along the North-South and Circle lines.

> ""Additional staff have been deployed to assist with crowd management. We are sorry to have affected commuters' peak-hour journeys,"" said SMRT.

> There are nine stations operating along the Thomson-East Coast Line, stretching from Woodlands North to Caldecott. The first three stations - Woodlands, Woodlands North and Woodlands South - opened to the public in January 2020, while six began passenger service in August 2021.

> Eleven more stations along the line, including those running through Stevens, Orchard and Outram Park, are expected to start service in the second half of this year.

> Singapore's recent spike in COVID-19 cases comes after Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last month that the country can expect a new wave of infections in July or August, as people's antibodies from vaccinations and infections from the last Omicron wave start to wane.

> SINGAPORE - Prices of food, transportation and energy here have been going up so fast that Singapore is now facing a cost-of-living crisis, said Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim on Tuesday (July 5).

> He added in Parliament that the situation has gone beyond an inflation problem, and stressed that the Government must do more to help.

> ""When the prices of what we eat, getting to work, and keeping our homes and businesses running are all rising rapidly, this isn't an inflation problem any longer,"" he said.

> ""It is a cost-of-living crisis. It is therefore incumbent on policymakers to do what they can to alleviate the pain felt by the people.""

> Associate Professor Lim (Sengkang GRC) suggested several ways this could be done, including strengthening the Singapore dollar and spending more funds to support those who need it the most.

> In response, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said that the Government plans and executes its fiscal policies for the long term, but maintains dexterity to zoom into details that matter on the ground to Singaporeans as well as local businesses.

> Its approach focuses on strong job creation and wage growth as the best ways to help Singaporeans tide over the current economic difficulties, and on making sure that the country has sufficient resources to tackle long-term challenges.

> ""This mindset and bias towards action have allowed us to weather storms and seize opportunities throughout our history. This is the hallmark of our government,"" he said.

> ""This is our commitment to Singapore, and we will continue to do our utmost to deliver on this commitment. Especially in these challenging times.""

> Mr Tan added that there is a need to recognise the global nature of price pressures that Singapore is facing.

> The sharp rise in food and oil prices since the fourth quarter of last year principally reflects the effects of serious disruption of global supply, including the Ukraine conflict, he said. “It is inevitable that some of these price increases will affect our economy.”

> On strengthening the Singapore dollar, Prof Lim said that doing so will reduce the cost of imported goods and services. A stronger currency could lower domestic inflation as well, given how so much of what is consumed here is imported.

> He added that there is ample evidence that such strengthening is affordable, given how standard metrics for comparing the under and overvaluation of the Singapore dollar suggest that it is significantly undervalued.

> Doing so could be as simple as ceasing interventions that restrain Singapore's exchange rate, and allowing foreign exchange markets to work, he said. ""This is a luxury that precious few countries can afford, but one that we can leverage now.""

> Mr Tan said Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), takes several factors into account when it comes to the exchange rate.

> Strengthening this rate cannot fully offset global prices without causing immediate negative consequences on growth, and therefore, the labour market, he warned.

> He said this is why many advanced central banks are guarded in the speed and the extent to which they will raise interest rates.

> ""Monetary policy action in and of themselves have attendant spillover effects that must be taken into account in the uncertain challenging economic environment. Therefore, a judicious blend of tight monetary policy and targeted supportive fiscal policy that is carefully calibrated is most appropriate,"" he said.

> In 2012, teachers and allied educators received a pay rise of between 5 and 15 per cent. Classroom teachers got an 8 per cent raise, which was meant to keep pace with the market, MOE said at that time.

> The 2015 review led to a 4 per cent to 9 per cent increase for teachers.

> He was responding to a question from Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) on whether his ministry would consider giving greater pay incentives to school counsellors across primary, secondary and tertiary institutions to attract sufficient counsellors of the highest quality and ensure low student-to-counsellor ratios.

> Mr Chan added that MOE and the institutes of higher learning periodically review salaries of staff to ensure pay packages remain competitive.

> Adjustments are also made, where necessary, to keep pace with the market, he added.

> Said Mr Chan: ""Besides competitive remuneration, counsellors are provided opportunities for professional development and growth, which is important for staff attraction and retention.

> ""MOE supports counsellors in honing their counselling competencies through courses and regular clinical supervision and consultation sessions with their clinical supervisor.""

> He did not elaborate on when the review would be completed, or by how much salaries would be adjusted.

> In June, the Government said 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 this year.

> It said at the time that these adjustments would not apply to civil servants in specialised schemes, such as accountants, police officers, teachers and foreign service officers.

> A Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Marine Parade has been sold for S$1.01 million, setting the record for the highest price for an HDB resale transaction in the estate.

> The five-room flat is on the 24th floor and has an unblocked view of East Coast Park from every window in the house.

> The unit

> According to The Straits Times (ST), the flat has a good size of 126sqm, a panoramic view of East Coast Park and is a five-minute walk away from Tao Nan School.

> Because of these factors, the sellers told ST that they were confident that the unit would fetch a good price.

> The unit also has a recess area, which is an additional free space outside the unit, that was bought by the unit's first owners.

> Also, under an upgrading programme for the estate in 1997, the unit has an additional utility room which was constructed by HBD, according to ST.

> Final price of $1,010,888

> According to ST, the sellers of the home, a Singaporean couple with three kids, were willing to let go of their home if they were offered a price above the S$1 million mark.

> This is the first flat in the Marine Parade area sold for that price.

> The sale was handled by PropNex property agents Colin Wong and Brian Ying, who told ST that it was the view from the unit that attracted buyers and helped with the deal.

> The unit was initially listed at S$999,000, but three interested buyers offered prices above $1 million.

> The sellers are the second owners of the unit. They bought it at approximately S$870,000 about 11 years ago.

> Despite having 51 years and nine months left on its 99-year lease, the property agents managed to close the deal a week after the unit was listed.

> The agents said that most interested buyers were older, living in private properties and looking to downgrade and settle in their last home.

> So, the age of the flat was not a concern.

> The price was finalised at $1,010,888 after four to five rounds of negotiation.

> Paid COV of under S$100,000

> One of the agents, Ying, said the buyers paid a Cash Over Valuation (COV) that was a little under S$100,000.

> According to Property Guru, COV is the difference between the agreed sale price of the flat between seller and buyer and its actual valuation by HDB. The amount must be paid in cash.

> COV is used to negotiate the price of the unit and is described by the site as ""overpaying"" for the resale unit since it tends to be above its valuation by HDB.

> In a case where the resale price is equal to the valuation of the flat, the buyers wouldn't need to pay COV.

> HBD resale prices on the rise

> On Jun. 9, real estate portal SRX reported that HDB resale prices have been on the rise for the 23rd straight month in May 2022.

> In late June 2022, a four-room HDB flat in Tiong Bahru was sold for S$1.158 million.

> Three executive HDB resale flats in Pasir Ris and Woodlands were sold for over a million dollars in May 2022, a first for both estates.

> SINGAPORE: Hospitals and residential care homes will impose limits on the number of visitors for four weeks from Thursday (Jul 7) amid a rise in COVID-19 community cases in Singapore.

> There will also be a cap on the duration of visits to these facilities, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> The measures - which will be in effect from Jul 7 to Aug 3 – are to protect healthcare capacity as well as vulnerable patients and residents during this period, said MOH.

> HOSPITAL VISITS

> All patients will be allowed two pre-designated visitors for the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at the bedside at any one time.

> Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors while two visitors may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time.

> The duration of a visit will be limited to 30 minutes.

> “In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals’ discretion,” said the Health Ministry.

> It added that all visitors should ensure that they are well and are ""strongly encouraged"" to test themselves with an antigen rapid test (ART) on the day of the visit.

> MOH said hospitals have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients.

> “Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patients’ beds.”

> RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES

> All residents at care homes will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one visitor may visit at any one time. The visit duration will be limited to 30 minutes.

> MOH said visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the home ahead of time. These visitors should also ensure that they are well, and are strongly encouraged to perform a self-test for COVID-19 on the day of the visit.

> “Visitors should strictly adhere to prevailing safe management measures within the Homes. This includes remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards.

> “We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details,” added MOH.

> The Health Ministry said all visitors must wear face masks with good filtration capability at all times while visiting hospitals or residential care homes. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric.

> MOH said that it will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving situation.

> “We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions and residential care homes.”

> SINGAPORE: Months before the impending closures of True Group fitness chains in Malaysia and Thailand, then CEO Patrick John Wee Ewe Seng was still allowing the sale of new gym memberships of up to five years.

> Staff in Malaysia did not even know about True Group's closure in the country until one day before, while gym members in Thailand were only informed on the day of the closure itself.

> In a judgment made available on Tuesday (Jul 5), a High Court judge found that Mr Wee's mismanagement of the closures of True Group's companies in Malaysia and Thailand was a breach of his duties to three other companies in the group.

> Mr Wee was the CEO and founder of True Group, which runs the True Yoga and True Fitness chains, from March 2008 until his termination in May 2018.

> The lawsuit was brought against him by three Singapore-incorporated companies in the group - True Yoga, True Fitness and True Fitness (STC).

> According to the plaintiffs, Mr Wee knew that True Group (Malaysia) was facing impending closure as early as February 2017. The company ceased operations on Jun 10, 2017.

> But he allowed the company to publicise and sell long-term gym memberships ranging from one-year to five-year periods until May 2017, with 43 such memberships sold before the closure.

> The plaintiffs said that he misled gym members by putting up a notice at one of the gyms saying that it was closed for renovation on May 10, 2017, when it was in fact closed for the court bailiff to take inventory under a writ of seizure for unpaid rental arrears.

> They also argued that Mr Wee conducted pre-sales for a new club in Plaza Damas, a development in Kuala Lumpur, that never opened, selling 50 such memberships from November 2016 to May 2017.

> As for True Group (Thailand), the plaintiffs said Mr Wee allowed membership fees to be collected from almost 39,000 members each month until end-May 2017, despite his knowledge of the impending closure.

> They accused him of allowing the sale of gym memberships of up to three years to prospective members, up to the first week of June 2017. The company ceased operations on Jun 9, 2017.

> They also argued that instead of dealing with the fallout from the closure, Mr Wee appointed one Ms Moonjaisai, the wife of his friend's tailor, to be sole director and his ""scapegoat"" once the closure came into effect, the judgment stated.

> The plaintiffs said that Mr Wee failed to provide gym members in Thailand with alternative fitness facilities after the closure. For those in Malaysia, there was an arrangement to use CHI Fitness facilities, but this abruptly ended in January 2018.

> Mr Wee's lawyers argued that his actions leading up to the closures were ""commercial decisions made in the best interests of True Group (Malaysia) and True Group (Thailand) given the circumstances"", the judgment stated.

> He also counterclaimed for wrongful termination and unpaid salary of S$120,000 a month for the period of Jan 1, 2018 to May 9, 2019, and salary in lieu of a year's notice for his termination.

> The plaintiffs argued that Mr Wee's termination was justified under his employment contract on the grounds of ""wilful misconduct or gross negligence"" in his mismanagement of the closures, the judgment stated.

> In his judgement, Justice Choo Han Teck agreed that Mr Wee had known that the True Group companies in Malaysia and Thailand were facing financial difficulties and impending closure since February 2017.

> He said Mr Wee knew that the True Group chains in Malaysia and Thailand would not be able to fulfil the long-term memberships they were still selling.

> ""The defendant ought to have known that the members would be outraged, and reasonably so, upon the closure of the gyms which would in turn damage True Group's reputation and businesses in other countries,"" said the judge.

> These actions taken in the lead up to the closures breached Mr Wee's duty to act diligently and in the best interests of the plaintiffs in managing the closures, said Justice Choo.

> He also said that Mr Wee's conduct suggested ""he was more concerned with evading responsibility as a director"" rather than dealing with the consequences of the closures on staff and gym members.

> Justice Choo cited Mr Wee's resignation days before the closure of True Group (Thailand), leaving Ms Moonjaisai as sole director to handle the winding up and creditors' claims, and his similar resignation before the closure of True Group (Malaysia).

> ""While these actions may not be breaches of the defendant's director duties in themselves, they shed light on his priorities and personal interests in managing the closures,"" said the judge.

> ""The evidence shows that Ms Moonjaisai was at a complete loss as to how to deal with the closure of the business,"" he added.

> Justice Choo also ruled that Mr Wee was entitled to unpaid salary of about S$62,660, but found that his employment was not wrongfully terminated.

> The judge reserved the issues of costs and quantification of the plaintiff's losses to a later date.

Since this hub is catered at the masses and not just the rich, perhaps they should also upgrade their public transport infrastructure?

Want to promote that airport, but the public transport options there are limited?

It’s about time to build that Seletar Line/North Coast Line if they want to start making good use of that airport (other than as the airport for private jets).

130,iex580v,t3_vrt7ns,2vx2xcyw,t3_vrt7ns,"> # Singapore’s Seletar Airport eyes future as a flying taxi hub

> By Anurag Kotoky

> (Bloomberg) — Just 20 minutes north-west of Singapore’s Changi Airport — regularly voted the world’s best — is Seletar Airport, the city-state’s second, and far well less known, airfield. It’s predominantly where the super rich land in their private jets. It’s also where the future of aviation could be taking off.

> The neighbourhood, more known for its laid-back cafes in restored British-era colonial buildings and sleepy fishing villages, is positioning itself as a hub for flying taxis. Singapore has already signed two agreements with advanced air mobility startups Skyports Ltd. and Volocopter GmbH that may convert the aging aerodrome into a vertiport, or an airport where the aerial devices take off and land vertically, Jetsons-style.

> It isn’t some way off dream, either. Plans for flying taxis to be operational at Seletar are pretty immediate — as soon as 2024 — and the airport, or vertiport, could serve as a global model for what the future of mobility may look like.

> Recent interest in so-called eVTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles) has been immense. Electric cabs stole the limelight at this year’s Singapore Air Show in February with Malaysian tycoon Tony Fernandes of AirAsia fame placing an order to rent at least 100 of them from Vertical Aerospace Ltd. Carriers including American Airlines Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. have also ordered scores of eVTOLs.

> “Singapore is, and continues to strive to be, the world leader in mobility, and this development is another brick in that wall,” said Sunny Xi, a principal at consultancy Oliver Wyman’s transportation and services practice. “This is more than simply solving traffic on roads. Singapore has all the right ingredients to test, learn and scale both the mobility adoption and the business to then export it across the world.”

> But flying taxis — until recently the stuff of science fiction — have one big and crucial hurdle to clear. Not one has been approved by regulators anywhere to actually take to the skies with passengers onboard. Authorities can take years to approve new technology and it’s only recently that flying taxis have a taken the giant leap from being a concept to a reality. Regulators are now examining the safety of such vehicles before green lighting them for commercial operations.

> Companies like Volocopter say it’s just a matter of time, and Asia will play a large role in eVTOL adoption.

> “In Asia, you have a high concentration of mega cities that you don’t have in any other region,” Christian Bauer, Volocopter’s chief commercial officer, said in an interview. “This new industry is innovative, it’s good for inhabitants, for tourists, and also for cross-border connections to relieve the pain of congestion.”

> Volocopter, which predicts S$4.2 billion ($3 billion) of cumulative economic benefits to Singapore and as many as 1,300 local jobs by 2030 from the industry, is showcasing its aircraft in the city-state later this month to increase public awareness. It’s also talked up the “political benefits” including reduced car ownership and the ability of Singapore to position itself as a torchbearer for the rest of Asia.

> Fares for passengers are expected to start at about 40% of the cost of a helicopter, according to Bauer. That could drop to around the price of a premium taxi within five to six years, he said.

> “This makes it interesting for anyone who can afford a taxi to take a Volocopter instead,” Bauer said, adding that the company’s service will be “very silent compared to a helicopter. You will not hear it at all.”

> Volocopter’s backers include Chinese automaking powerhouse Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. as well as German logistics firm DB Schenker and the venture capital arm of chipmaker Intel Corp. Skyports is supported by Japan’s Kanematsu Corp. and Goodman Group in Australia, and counts Ken Allen, the CEO of DHL eCommerce, as a board member.

> For all the behind-the-scenes work, the burgeoning revolution underway at Seletar isn’t visible yet.

> On a recent visit, the airfield was littered with private and small trainer planes, with a few bigger jets in hangars undergoing repairs. Patrons at an aviation-themed bistro overlooking the runway were mostly expats or locals with jobs at nearby plane-maintenance companies. Inside the terminal, staff were busy guiding a handful of passengers onto a flight to Subang Jaya in Malaysia — one of the only two commercial services operating from the airport.

> Read More: Volocopter aims to have electric air taxis in Singapore in 2024

> Singapore’s Jurong Town Corporation , commonly known at JTC and a primary state-run developer of real estate, is bullish on Seletar’s scope. The broader area surrounding the airstrip, called Seletar Aerospace Park, is the centerpiece of Singapore’s aerospace industry cluster and home to around 60 companies spanning businesses from engine makers, repairs, research and training.

> “The future of urban air mobility is exciting and presents far-reaching possibilities for Seletar Aerospace Park,” Lim Ai Ting, JTC’s director of aerospace and marine cluster, said. “We’re currently in discussions with various parties on new partnerships. This will add to the park’s vibrancy and also benefit the aerospace industry ecosystem.”

> With about 82,500 passenger eVTOLs expected to be operational in Asia Pacific by 2050, the region will account for around half the global market, according to a study by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and consultancy Roland Berger released earlier this year. The flying devices could be used as airport shuttles, for tourist flights or inter-city travel, flying as far as 250 kilometres (155 miles) on a single charge, according to the study.

> “With its high-rise and high-density landscape, and highly efficient domestic transport systems, the vision in Singapore is focused first on tourist flights, and ultimately, regional connectivity,” said Yun Yuan Tay, Skyports’ head of APAC. Seletar, with its integrated cluster of aerospace-related facilities, is “the perfect setting for the holistic development of an industry as new as advanced air mobility,” he said.

> More broadly, eVTOLs’ advancement isn’t limited to just Singapore, or Asia.

> A unit of Kenya Airways Plc agreed last month to buy as many as 40 flying taxis starting in 2026 from EVE UAM, part of US-headquartered Eve Holding Inc. And England’s Coventry, once known as Britain’s motor city, is gearing up to host what’s being billed as the first-ever fully functional hub for flying taxis this spring. The site, on a car parking lot at a busy junction across the road from Coventry’s main railway station, is being developed by Urban-Air Port Ltd., a London-based startup that competes with Skyports.

> “The good thing is, a couple of years back, we were approaching cities,” said Volocopter’s Bauer. “Now cities are approaching Volocopter because they see the demand, they see this revolutionary change, and they want to be there. Singapore is high on the list.”

> Outside of regulatory approval, another hurdle is range, with eVTOLs’ flying time relatively limited. Potential electrification of popular passenger planes like Airbus SE’s A320s series or Boeing Co.’s 737 family has been largely ruled out due to the immense weight of the batteries that would be required to fly hundreds of miles.

> The fact the aerial devices are electric isn’t going to put much of a dent in aviation’s huge carbon footprint, either.

> About 80% of the industry’s carbon emissions come from flights longer than 1,500 kilometres, which is why flying taxis won’t be a solution in the near term, the International Air Transport Association’s Director General Willie Walsh said in May. The biggest lobby group for airlines is “conservative” about the impact the technology will have on the industry’s path to net zero, Walsh said.

> Oliver Wyman’s Xi agrees. He sees all-electric propulsion restricted to short-haul aircraft applications for mainly commuter, or between nine to 19 seat, applications.

> “Without significant improvements in the specific energy density of batteries compared to kerosene, it’s unlikely that electric planes will threaten modern commercial aviation.”

> The age threshold will be increased in phases from April 2023, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling in Parliament. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will aim to complete the expansion of the scheme by October next year.

> ""This can only be done when the number of AA volunteers is increased,"" said Ms Sun, referring to volunteers under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS).

> Under the AAYS, an appropriate adult - an independent, trained volunteer - is activated for all suspects under the age of 16 during police interviews.

> MHA had said last year that it is reviewing the scheme to see if it could be extended to suspects who are 16 and 17 years old. This came after the case of 17-year-old drug suspect Justin Lee, who died after falling from height, months after his arrest.

> Justin was arrested in February 2021 and charged with drug trafficking offences in June, before being released on bail. He died on Sep 16.

> The Central Narcotics Bureau launched an investigation into how Justin was treated and questioned after his mother alleged that he was mistreated during the process.

> While the agency concluded that he was treated ""professionally and fairly"" during investigations, and that there was ""no mistreatment"" when he was in the lock-up, the case prompted questions from MPs at that time about law enforcement agencies' protocols when dealing with young suspects.

I had no choice but to contact town council after that and they went down to talk to them, but to no avail. No choice but to call the police on them but the police said they can’t do much also. 

Then did mediation at the CMC, the mediator was far from understanding and neutral, seemed to side with them and said that their suggestion that the sound came from their neighbour to the side and above them was plausible (how is that possible when my lights are vibrating and i can tell exactly which direction and where they are running).

> Will you leave your job if you're asked to go back into the office everyday?

> Younger workers, those between 18 and 34, are more reluctant than their older colleagues to return to the workplace full-time, amid Singapore’s reopening and employers encouraging staff to go back into the office.

> These are results from the ADP Research Institute’s People at Work 2022: A Global Workforce View that was published on July 4.

> According to the survey of almost 33,000 workers in 17 countries, more than seven in 10 (71%) of 18-24 year olds and two thirds (66%) of 25-34 year olds would consider looking for another job if their employer insisted on a full-time return to the workplace, compared to 56% of the 45-54 age bracket.

> In Singapore, more than five in 10 younger workers (between the ages of 18-24 and 25-34) would contemplate leaving if asked to return to work full-time. In comparison, only 35% of Singapore workers above 55 years old would contemplate quitting if this happened.

> This could be a potential friction point as some industries, such as construction, manufacturing and F&B, may not be able to implement a hybrid work system. Industries like F&B and retail also have a higher reliance on younger workers, as compared to other industries.

> Yvonne Teo, Vice President of HR, ADP, comments: “As lockdowns have eased in different countries, the question of whether workers can be compelled to return to the workplace full-time is a divisive topic. For many it could be a pivotal issue, potentially triggering a decision to leave.”

> “It is worth investigating the willingness of workers to return to the office and balancing this with what would work best for the business. When workers return to the office, managers have important roles to make in-person collaborations meaningful to engage younger workers. This will help to build a more connected internal culture and enhance trust and loyalty between employers and staff,” adds Teo, who is aware of the challenges for certain industries such as manufacturing, retail and F&B, which have job scopes that tough to implement a hybrid or flexible work schedule.

> SINGAPORE: The current wave of COVID-19 infections will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Jul 5).

> Responding to a parliamentary question from MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) about the Government's response to the current wave of COVID-19 cases, Mr Ong said the authorities had anticipated this wave when they learnt of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.

> These subvariants have a ""significant growth advantage"" over the earlier BA.2 subvariant, he added.

> “This wave, however, arrived slightly earlier than the July and August timeframe that we anticipated,” the Health Minister said.

> “For this current wave, our assessment is that it will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year. This is because many more of us have gained stronger immunity either through booster shots or recovery from infections,"" he added.

> “This will significantly impede the circulation and transmission of the virus.”

> COVID-19 case numbers on Tuesday are expected to be more than 12,000, about 10 per cent more than Tuesday last week, he noted.

> ""There are indications that we are near the peak, if not at the peak, and we should be relieved that the number this week did not double from last week. Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" said Mr Ong.

> In response to a question from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) if healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”.

> This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.

> “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated (intensive care unit) and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.

> There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied.

> The facilities were “recently consolidated” from more than 2,000 beds to about 1,300 beds, with a “higher manning ratio”, said Mr Ong. This makes it easier to transfer patients from hospitals to the facilities without a “significant drop” in levels of care, he added.

> However, public hospitals continue to face “high demand” from non-COVID-19 patients, said Mr Ong.

> “Over time, we hope more of our (COVID-19 treatment facilities) can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,” he added.

> The COVID-19 treatment facility at Sengkang Community Hospital has been “reconfigured” to this new model, and the authorities will explore converting other facilities, said the Health Minister.

> In anticipating the wave of infections, the Government maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were “low and stable”, to “moderate the infection rate” when the new wave arrived.

> “If we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent safe management measures will need to be implemented. And that means reintroducing things like group sizes, capacity limits and masking outdoors,” said Mr Ong.

> ""We cannot rule out these steps when we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey to endemicity.""

> SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for eight weeks on Tuesday (Jul 5) for taking nude videos of his ex-girlfriend with a spy camera in the room that they used to share.

> The 48-year-old man pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the woman's modesty. Another two similar charges were considered for sentencing.

> The victim's identity is protected by gag order, and the man's name cannot be published as it could lead to her identification.

> The court heard that the man and his girlfriend broke up in September 2019, and he moved out of the room they shared. But he still had access to the room as he knew the password for the lock.

> In October 2019, he installed a pinhole camera in the room. He hid the camera among luggage, covering it with a black sheet that was used to keep dust off the luggage.

> The victim discovered the camera in November 2019 when she took the luggage out to pack her belongings. She viewed the videos recorded by the camera and realised that several of them captured her nude.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Shao Yan sought two months' jail, noting that the use of technology to make the recordings increased the potential for circulation of the nude videos.

> Defence counsel Chung Ting Fai asked for four weeks' jail, arguing that his client was motivated by curiosity and jealousy over his failed relationship with the victim.

> Mr Chung told the court that his client and the victim had lived together for seven years and travelled to China to meet each other's parents, and that his client intended to marry her.

> But the lawyer said his client suspected his girlfriend was unfaithful after viewing footage from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera they placed outside the room for security.

> When he confronted her about this, she denied ever bringing another man into their home, according to the lawyer.

> This led the offender to feel betrayed, saddened and jealous, said Mr Chung. He then decided to install the pinhole camera to ascertain if the victim was bringing another man home.

> The prosecution acknowledged these motivations, and Mr Ng said the sentence sought already took into account that his conduct did not appear to be for nefarious purposes.

> District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said that the man's actions nonetheless still constituted an invasion of the victim's privacy.

> The punishment for insulting a woman's modesty is up to a year in jail, a fine or both.

> Delays were also caused by other issues, such as applicants submitting photos that did not meet ICA's requirements.

They referred me to a family doctor trained with handling mental conditions; apparently it’s a new scheme that IMH is doing to ease the flow of patients coming through. 

The family doctor tried to pin down the cause of my anxiety attacks because mine were bad enough for me to forget my episodes after they happen. I asked him if I could get checked for ADHD because as a kid, I got a referral by the allied educator in school to get tested for it. Family doctor managed to pin down that my anxiety was caused by my ADHD being left undiagnosed and untreated. He referred me to IMH to an adult ADHD specialist. That appointment where he did that was two weeks ago. Got a call last night that my appointment is in October which isn’t as bad as the other people I’ve read who had to wait one year plus for an appointment.

I think I got the quicker route because I got diagnosed with anxiety from my undiagnosed ADHD, thus the family doctor referring me to specifically an adult ADHD specialist at IMH. 

If you can hang in there a little longer, just go through the public health route. If it’s affecting you very badly day to day like mine, then I recommend private.

> She said: ""We will not be able to eliminate all risks. To so do would be costly and uneconomical. We will also not be able to isolate Singapore from the price fluctuations of food supply.""

> She added that in recent months, even countries with sizeable food production capacities have faced higher food prices because of higher costs of feedstock, fertilisers and transportation.

> Singapore's food security strategies include ensuring a diverse network of food sources, growing more food locally, and working closely with industry partners to maintain stockpiles of essential food items.

> Asked if the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has considered exploring the use of offshore islands such as Pulau Ubin for poultry or agricultural uses, Ms Fu acknowledged that such suggestions have commonly been heard during discussions on Singapore's food resilience plan.

> She said: ""I think our priority must be to meet a significant proportion of our food supply needs. Build up significant skill sets so that we have the production knowledge and capability onshore to support us in times of need.""

> She explained that the challenge for the country will be to increase food production with less than 1 per cent of land set aside for agri-food production.

> ""In many cases, we're looking at productivity to the multiple of 10 times of what we're doing now in order to give us the bulk that we need.""

> Addressing questions on Singapore's efforts to expand the number of approved countries for poultry imports, Ms Fu said: ""Even as we diversify our food sources, food safety remains paramount. Only accredited sources that meet Singapore's food safety and animal health standards will be allowed to export to Singapore. This has not hindered our diversification efforts. Specifically for chicken, 25 countries are accredited.""

> According to SFA, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply comes from Malaysia. Most of those chickens are imported live and slaughtered here. Singapore also receives chilled and frozen chicken from countries including Thailand, Australia and Brazil.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore prefers to focus on farming ""resource-efficient"" food items instead of poultry because of land, labour, energy and water constraints, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu in Parliament on Monday (Jul 4).

> ""We prefer to concentrate on farming food items that can be produced in a resource-efficient and commercially sustainable manner,"" she said.

> Citing data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Ms Fu said that the CO2-equivalent emissions generated from producing 1kg of chicken for meat are about three times that of some fish.

> Ms Fu was responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about Singapore's food supply and the impact of Malaysia's chicken export ban.

> Ms Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) asked if the authorities would consider setting local production targets for poultry and poultry products under Singapore's “30 by 30” food security goal to enhance the resilience of Singapore’s supply of poultry. Under the “30 by 30"" goal, Singapore aims to produce up to 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent today.

> Mr Shawn Huang (PAP-Jurong) asked about the impact of the chicken supply disruption and the Government's long-term approach to poultry supply in Singapore.

> This remark apparently caused the woman to turn back.

> She said: ""Don't call me ma'am. I will not teach you anything.""

> The woman then continued: ""I will kick you. Do you want me to kick your ass?""

> A minute later, the woman in the skin care face mask started screaming as she was pinned to the ground by the bystander.

> Kang said: ""This is really suay (unlucky), you know. Come here, eat, then kenna (encounter) this kind of thing.""

> All the while, the member of public who stepped in to help continued to hold the woman down.

> Woman started to sing

> Mendoza told TNP she is grateful to the passerby who helped them: “The Malay lady very kind, and helped us out of nowhere.”

> SINGAPORE - Central Provident Fund (CPF) members’ balances have hit a new high, exceeding half a trillion dollars as at the end of last year.

> Their balances grew by 9.4 per cent to $505.7 billion – from $462.1 billion in 2020 – according to the CPF Board’s annual report released on Monday (July 4).

> A record $18.3 billion in interest was paid to members last year. In 2020, members received $16.8 billion in interest.

> Voluntary top-ups to Special and Retirement Accounts also climbed to a new high of $4.8 billion last year, up from $3 billion in 2020, said the report.

> The top-ups were made by 294,000 CPF members, with about half topping up for the first time.

> However, the amount withdrawn for housing has gone up. Some 996,000 members used a total of $21.9 billion of their CPF savings for their housing needs last year – a jump from the $17.3 billion in 2020.

> Last year, the number of CPF members increased by 2.0 per cent to 4.1 million.

> About 416,000 members received monthly CPF retirement payouts totalling $2.2 billion last year.

> Of these, more than 85,000 members are on the CPF Life scheme, which provides a lifelong monthly payout that begins when the member turns 65 years old.

> The CPF system provides members with a solid foundation for peace of mind in retirement, said CPF Board’s chairman Yong Ying-I in the report. “In 2021, we made efforts to strengthen this foundation, with schemes to boost the retirement income of members with lower balances and lesser means.”

> For instance, the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme was launched last year to help seniors who have not reached their Basic Retirement Sum to build their retirement savings through a dollar-for-dollar matching grant.

> Under this scheme, the government matches cash top-ups made to the Retirement Account of eligible Singaporeans aged 55 to 70, up to an annual cap of $600. Over 117,000 members benefitted from $68 million in matching grants from the government for cash top-ups made last year.

> According to the annual report, the CPF Board also assisted 8,496 members who were in financial distress amid the Covid-19 pandemic by connecting them with agencies that can provide help beyond what it can offer, under the Rejected Appeals Management Protocol initiative.

> The number of transactions performed on the CPF website and mobile app nearly doubled to 171 million last year, from 90 million in 2020.

I know your situation. I'm moving between various lodging locations so I can't commit to a landline so I recently went to ZYM which piggybacks on SingTel's network and got a SIM card plan for $28 for 70GB, this is the 'Max' plan. If you're only using it for 1 day then there are cheaper options, $9.90 for 9.9GB.

However, you will still need a 'modem' for the SIM card. You have 2 options from there on.

1) Use your phone. If your phone doesn't have dual SIM slot and you need to use your main number to contact your interviewer/whatever then you're shit out of luck on this. If it has dual SIM slot then you can put your new SIM card in it and use it as a hot spot transmitter. 

2) Get a 4G SIM card Modem Dongle. There are various brands. I bought TP-Link and it fucking sucks ass. I thought the more expensive would mean quality but no, it all sucks dick and there are various complaints on the forums. If you're getting a dongle, do NOT fucking get TP-link. My model for comparison is a M7450 which costs over $200 and resets constantly. Go get some other brand. This item costs ranges from $50 to $200+. Since you're only using it for 1 day, you should just get the cheapest imo. You basically slot the SIM card into the device turn it on and it'll automatically transmit its SSID. 

You can PM me if you have more questions on this.

TL;DR: $9.90 for cheapest ZYM SIM data plan, $50+ for the dongle to use that SIM or you can use your smartphone.",2022-07-04 11:55:05+08:00,14,1656907106.0

421,ierwfza,t3_vqwtbe,5kb8k,t3_vqwtbe,"Les Maisons is a low-rise development of just 14 units coming up on Nassim Road, a leafy street nestled between the bustling shopping district of Orchard Road on one end and the expansive quiet of the Singapore Botanic Gardens on the other. As Business Insider described it, Nassim is the Lion City’s very own Beverly Hills. And right now, property prices along this mile-long stretch of hyper-exclusivity are scorching hot.

In May, a 6,092 square-foot apartment in Maisons Nassim was sold by its Hong Kong-based developer Shun Tak Holdings, which is run by the late Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho’s daughters Pansy, Daisy and Maisy. It went for S$37 million ($27 million), the fourth-highest per square foot price on record for a new Singapore condo, according to OrangeTee & Tie, a property brokerage.

The buyer’s identity isn’t known. It could be a Singaporean tycoon who wrote the check, but the Les Maisons unit might well have been one of the 84 snapped up in May by foreigners, marking a big-bang return of global interest in Singapore property after the first quarter’s lull. Nor would it be a surprise if the money came from an expatriate banker: Permanent residents bought 142 units in May, compared with 79 the previous month.

Mind you, such things weren’t supposed to happen this year. For both foreigners and PRs, already-steep additional stamp duties were further raised in December. Foreigners have to shell out a 30% levy, while PRs now pay 25% on their second homes and an unchanged 5% on first purchases. Only Singapore citizens buying their first homes are exempt from additional duties, which sit on top of the standard graded rate that rises to a maximum of 4% above S$1 million of market value. Despite such high taxation, there’s suddenly no dearth of homebuyers in Singapore, either local or foreign. The inescapable conclusion is this: The city-state’s latest property curbs have already lost their sting.  

Will the Singapore authorities need to introduce more draconian restrictions? Maybe not this year, provided the U.S. Federal Reserve remains hawkish enough to deliver a second 75-basis-point increase in interest rates in July.

Since the 2009 start of the global cheap-money era, Singapore has made 11 attempts to rein in speculation in its residential property market. The goal has been to prevent prices from rising too fast too soon; the tools have ranged from higher stamp duties to lower mortgage loan-to-value limits and stricter debt servicing ratios for homebuyers. But the effect of these so-called cooling measures doesn’t last. “Sentiment typically recovers around two to six months after each round,” says Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.

This time, it’s back to business-as-usual in five months. After surging 10.6% in 2021, Singapore home prices inched up by just 0.7% in the first quarter. However, developer sales for May seem to suggest strong pent-up demand. What’s more, activity appears to be heating up when money is no longer cheap. DBS Group Holdings Ltd., the island’s largest bank, recently raised the rate on its two-year fixed rate package by 0.3 percentage points to 2.75% per annum, according to The Straits Times. Other banks have already made their mortgage plans more expensive. 

One reason why potential condo buyers are still keen is skyrocketing rents. According to a Bloomberg News survey of real-estate agents, rental prices are rising 20% to 40% on average for private homes leased by expatriates. Tenants are coming back. “Foreigners have begun to, slowly but surely, return to the city as the country further relaxes safety management measures and opens its borders,” says PropertyGuru Pte., which runs a popular online property portal. That changes the buy-or-rent equation for self-occupiers even at higher mortgage interest rates; it could also bring in yield-seeking investment, or at least offset the impact of higher annual property taxes for non-owner-occupiers from 2023. (Unlike the stamp duties, the property taxes aren’t a cooling measure; their main goal is to keep a lid on wealth inequality in the financial center.)

Limited supply of new homes is also attracting buyers to new projects that are getting launched. Billionaire Kwek Leng Beng’s City Developments Ltd. and its partner MCL Land Holdings sold 77% of their jointly developed 407-unit Piccadilly Grand over one weekend in early May at an average price of S$2,150 per square foot.  

A rare Nassim Road property can afford to be pricey; Piccadilly Grand, too, sits on a location central enough to command a premium. But if like last year, the froth starts to spill over into middle-class, suburban homes, authorities will have to come in and break up the party. For now, though, they just might wait for the Fed to do the job.

But will it? Singapore’s rapid post-pandemic re-opening offers a stark contrast with arch-rival Hong Kong. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that new-home sales in the Chinese special administrative region could fall 20% this year. It’s in Hong Kong — and not Singapore — where the rising cost of capital may really come to bite. That’s because weak economic activity means lackluster rental demand. A landlord who’ll earn a rental yield of 2.2% on an investment property, and pay a floating mortgage interest rate of 2.2% — subject to a sharp increase — may as well head over to Singapore. Looks like they already are.

This in turn led me to also lose interest in my work. It's not like I had an emotional connection to it in the first place, but I started to find it meaningless and unfulfilling.

The past two years were particularly bad. Got recalled back to office immediately after circuit breaker just because they wanted to see me physically. I was sent to an office almost 2 hours away from home again. I had my pay cut in half by being ordered to go on no-pay leave for a period of time for no reason (probably punishment for something I did, my big boss has done this to others). I was asked to pack up my belongings and move out of a site office in less than half a day without having the chance to say goodbye to people I knew. This month, I was moved to an office where 5 people were expected to work inside a space the size of a shipping container. Since the start of this year, I started having thoughts of suicide just to escape work and regularly googling 'I want to die'. Felt that life was hopeless with no future except experiencing this over and over, if not at this job then at others.

I'm leaving with nothing lined up because I feel that I'm in no shape to jump immediately to another job when I'm this full of toxicity and negativity. My plan was to take a few months to rest and get back in touch with myself, but I'm worried that I've committed career suicide by generating a big red flag for future employers by becoming voluntarily unemployed, especially when I'm just shy of 40 years old. I was miserable at my job, but have I set myself up for permanent misery because I couldn't shut up and adult?

Sorry for the long-winded whining. For everyone on the DT who has listened to me moan about my life and job almost every day for the past 6 years, I apologize.",2022-07-04 20:25:14+08:00,43,False

Finally I (29m) threw my letter of resignation today because today is independence day. Just kidding

I worked in this company for 3 years and not a single cent was raised. With 10 years of working experience, my salary is only around mid 2s. I only got a lesser and lesser workload and I eventually got bored of my job.

Anyway, when i first joined the company as a media/marketing related role, i had plenty of ideas and passion to help the company to stand out in the industry. But my ideas and suggestions were quickly turned down by my supervisor and boss. That's when i realised, they don't need my expertise, they only need my hands and legs to work the way they wanted.

A few months into the company, my boss walked to me and said ""I don't want you to be a robot, you need to be creative"". Even though there is nothing I can do at this point.

My boss and supervisor who aren't trained or studied in marketing / media chose to believe in themselves more than me. I specifically told my supervisor our company acted like an atas brand, but market like pasa malam lelong lelong. If they wanted to be branded, they have to research and see how big brands market themselves.

And in order to be ahead of the industry, we have to do something different. We have to go deep into customers perspectives. What customers wanted to see, and not what we wanted to see. They rather post on their social media ""happy new year / merry christmas / this is our top sales team"" which is so redundant because definitely customers aren't drawn to these. Moreover, they always like their own posts and acted like they are so popular.

I again suggested some ideas for a change, but was rejected again! A few years down the road, social influencers suddenly started doing what I have been telling my company to do. Instead of realising i am right all along. My supervisor told me ""xxx, see this. They do so nice. So many people watching. We should do something different from what we usually do""

At this point, I have already given up on using my brain.
Even my company started outsourcing freelancers to redo my work and I was told that I am cheap, therefore I wasn't that good TWICE by different people.

I was given work outside my jobscope and was judged by my supervisor for being ""lazy"" because my work wasn't that great. It wasn't even my strength to begin with. I merely help out due to her being overloaded with work.

Worse time to argue with my supervisor and soon its appraisal date. Instead of 100 over colleagues that I spent my 80-90% time working with, my appraisal was done by my supervisor who hardly saw me.

As soon as I joined the company, my company broke the sales record year after year. Yet my bonus shrunken. Salary remains the same.

I felt so mentally tired of doing nothing and judged for doing nothing so i decided to leave for good. 

Today i walked into my boss's office and gave him the letter with a polite smile. All i got was ""okay"" from him. I further said that in the mean time or after i leave, if the company needs any help, I am more than willing to help out. He only said thank you as i leave his office. He did not seem to be bothered by my sudden resignation or wanted me to stay.

As I was on my way home on the MRT, I got a bit curious and began to search my company to see if they were hiring. That was when I saw my company actually hiring a role that is similar to my job with a salary between 100%-160% of mine. It was posted 1 week ago.

And no, it's impossible to have an additional colleague because the fact that I already have nothing much to do. So highly likely it is to take over me in the company.

So long story short, if I never quit today, i may get fired tomorrow. I left without securing another job.

You may be asking why I didn't leave earlier. I have an adjustment disorder. Hence i don't cope well with changes. And I am actually happy to work in my role. It would just be better if i have given the trust and opportunity to do much more, given that i am the only one in the company that have the related education and experiences in marketing/media.

> SINGAPORE - They may look similar to the button one presses to activate the green man at a traffic junction, but at two new pedestrian crossings here, a wave of the hand is all that is needed to signal an intention to cross the road.

> As part of a six-month trial by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), contactless push buttons were on Thursday (June 30) installed in Jalan Besar, near Syed Alwi Road, and Tampines Street 86, close to Block 879A.

> By the end of this month, the buttons will also be on traffic light poles at new crossings in Bukit Batok Street 32, near St Anthony's Primary School, and Yishun Street 21, near Block 219.

> Signs with pictures showing how the contactless devices work will be on the traffic light poles at the four trial locations.

> Mr Jerry Heng, LTA's deputy director for traffic, street and commuter facilities lighting, said the current push buttons can become defective due to improper use.

> Worn out buttons may not send a signal for the green man when pushed, or they may get stuck and keep sending the same green man signal to the system.

> As they age, the buttons require more maintenance and, with more than 11,000 installed at about 2,400 traffic junctions, the work can add up.

> Over the years, some buttons have also been vandalised and abused through ""repeated triggering"", Mr Heng said.

> Due to misconceptions among pedestrians that each press will make the traffic light turn in their favour quicker, this has led to wear and tear being accelerated, reducing the button's expected 15- to 20-year lifespan, he added.

> The hope is that without the mechanical button and physical contact, the new contactless devices will be more reliable and easier to upkeep - saving costs and manpower in the long run.

> The contactless buttons also minimise the transmission of Covid-19 and other diseases, with similar trials conducted over the past couple of years in Australia and Canada for this reason.

> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported in November last year that touchless pedestrian button trials in Melbourne received positive feedback, and drew interest from New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore.

> According to the ABC report, the buttons used in the trials cost A$320 (S$305) - about A$100 more than the current ones.

> Mr Heng said that to keep the costs of the trial in Singapore low, the contactless buttons being tested here are modifications of the regular ones. But LTA may come up with a new form if the trial run succeeds.

> For now, there is still a button in the middle of the new device, but it cannot be used. On the right is an infrared sensor that will detect when a pedestrian waves his hand in front of it.

> Chewing tobacco smuggled

> The officers at the checkpoint conducted checks and uncovered chewing tobacco wrapped in black trash bags.

> About 639kg of chewing tobacco was found.

> The bags were concealed within a modified floorboard underneath the consignment.

> The case has been referred to Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for further investigation.

> ICA said:

> SINGAPORE - When American linguists Keri Matwick and Kelsi Matwick came to Singapore in 2018, one thing that caught their eye was toilet etiquette posters featuring the use of comics.

> Dr Keri Matwick, a lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) School of Humanities, says she and her twin sister found these posters ""humorous but complex"" as they were not common in other countries.

> ""We started noticing these posters and thinking, 'Oh, this is really interesting,'"" she adds.

> They were so intrigued that they decided to analyse the use of humour in these posters, which come under the Keep Public Toilets Clean campaign.

> Their research led to a paper titled ""Comics and humour as a mode of government communication on public hygiene posters in Singapore"", which was published in the Discourse, Context & Media journal in April this year.

> The study notes that ""the choice of the comic genre as the medium of the message allows for a made-up world"", helping to make taboo topics more relatable and memorable to the public.

> In addition, the comics' ""humour and visual-verbal interplay, simple narrative plot and exaggerated characters make it possible to remind, instruct and chide without sounding overbearing"".

> Says Dr Kelsi Matwick, adjunct lecturer at the College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida: ""Research has shown that humour can improve learning, attention span and retention of a message. The brevity of comics' messages can grab viewers' attention and increase the retention of its message.""

> Most people in Singapore would have seen these posters, which are found in public toilets in places such as libraries, train stations and hawker centres, and feature comics drawn by cartoonist Lee Chee Chew of The Straits Times.

> One example is the ""Use The Hand Dryer Or Hand Towels"" poster, which shows a bespectacled man watching a fellow toilet user flick water onto the floor after washing his hands, eventually causing himself to slip and fall.

> On this comic strip, Dr Keri Matwick says: ""Both the language and semiotics of the comic work together to make it funny and instructional.""

> Adds Dr Kelsi Matwick: ""The lesson of the comic is explicit, with the line saying, for example, 'Clean public toilets are possible.'

> ""By linking the image of the hand flick to this comic, connections to discourse of social irresponsibility and disgrace are made. The underlying message is that following social rules in public washrooms is an intelligent way to act.""

This was the ""great affective divide"" period; Ngiam was far from alone in being the bureaucratic elite voicing concerns at alien technocrats chipping away at the PAP's personalised grip on the machinery of the economy via privatization. Notice that these anxieties were mainly voiced in English and spread in the domestic English-language press (which mattered back in the 1990s). 

The attack did stick in minds, which is why today we see the HDB, neighbourhood primary school, etc. backgrounds. of CCS, HSK, LW, etc. highlighted. 

However - today the PAP is not facing an opposition led by a Chinese-educated LTK and CST but with equally English-educated highly elite professional leaders, more akin the old lawyerly WP of JBJ once again. As the demographic has become more English-speaking and educated, so has Singapore's political class, both government and opposition alike. I would expect that this particular attack will no longer be as resonant in the 2020s and 2030s; instead, the anxiety will be that the PAP is now mediocre and can no longer deliver the (supposed) hypercompetent and far-sighted leadership that it has built a mythology around.

> On the issue of ministerial pay, Ngiam added that he knew some ministers who had given up successful and well-paying careers in the private sector to join politics at a much lower pay. 

a few ministers who used to be high paid lawyers and doctors cover for the entire cabinet. most of them just career civil servants or taken from glc. this is circular logic already. anyway why do we want to hire them at such high pay. what about being a high paid lawyer or surgeon means can be a good minister? totally different skills sets.

> This makes her the singer with the most wins in the category, beating three-timer winner A-mei, from Taiwan.

> She won four awards in total on Saturday - her album Depart was named Best Mandarin Album, Album of the Year and Best Vocal Album Recording.

> During her acceptance speech as Best Female Singer (Mandarin), Chua, 47, said that when she first entered the industry in the late 1990s, she knew how to sing only English songs.

> She said: ""When I tried singing Mandarin songs, I had to flip through the dictionary. At one point, I really wanted to give up.""

> Referring to her first Golden Melody Award win in 2006 - also in the Best Female Singer (Mandarin) category - she said: ""The award saved me. It reached out its hand, told me to keep singing.""

> Her Best Vocal Album Recording win on Saturday was unexpected, Chua said, given that the album - her 12th - was recorded with a guitar and a microphone amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when movement was still being restricted.

> The work reflects her thoughts on the pandemic and its impact on the way people live. Among its tracks is the song Photographs, a duet with France's former first lady and singer-model Carla Bruni.

> Almost 30 awards were given out at the 2022 ceremony, which took place at the Kaohsiung Arena, and was hosted by veteran television host Daniel Lo.

> SINGAPORE: Drivers to Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint may see a futuristic structure looming ahead, allowing them to go through contactless immigration clearance.

> Just enter the canopy, scan your passport and you'll be prompted for your facial and iris biometrics.

> Called the Automated Passenger In-Car Clearance System (APICS), it is currently being trialled at the checkpoint. It began on Jun 21 and will end in October, with authorities to announce more operational details at a later date.

> The system was developed by the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX).

> A first prototype of the system was trialled in 2017 and findings showed that self-clearance of travellers in vehicles is “feasible”, said HTX in a media factsheet.

> As part of the first prototype, laser scanners would detect the position of car windows before robotic arms would extend a cradle supporting wireless biometric devices to travellers. Those in the vehicle would then scan their thumbprints and be photographed on these devices, before returning the device to the cradle.

> The system was adjusted for the current trial.

> “Essentially, what we took away are all the robotic fixtures that require a lot of movement, a lot of moving parts and made the process (of clearing immigration) more seamless,” said Mr Cheng Wee Kiang during a media showcase of APICS. Mr Cheng is director of HTX's Robotics, Automation and Unmanned Systems Centre of Expertise.

> But while Singapore can stop hate speech from physically entering the country, it cannot fully stop what comes through online, he said.

> ""Our people, especially the young, must know to seek guidance from credible religious authorities, and to reject extremism and hate speech.""

> IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON TERRORISM

> In his speech at the retreat, Mr Teo noted that the pandemic has made it difficult for terrorists to plan, prepare and carry out attacks, especially across borders, in the last two years.

> However, terrorist groups stepped up their propaganda and recruitment efforts online.

> ""As people spent more time online, we continued to see a stream of self-radicalisation cases during the pandemic,"" he said.

> ""As we reopen our borders, there will be a surge in international travel. So there may be a renewed terrorism threat as foreign fighters return home or travel to conflict zones. There will also be more opportunities for lone-wolf attacks.""

> SINGAPORE - Some owners of flats undergoing the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) in Ang Mo Kio said they will likely take up a new rehousing option for a replacement flat on a shorter 50-year lease.

> It is one of two new rehousing options introduced on Saturday (July 2) by the Housing Board to provide more options that meet the different needs of Sers flat owners.

> Sers flat owners in Ang Mo Kio will be the first to get these options.

> Technician Ghazali Abdul Rahman, 60, told The Straits Times that the new option will allow him to move into his new flat when he is set to retire in 2027 with some cash in hand.

> He is considering a four-room replacement unit as it is just slightly smaller than his current three-room corner unit, but getting one with a 99-year lease would have left him owing an estimated $40,000 for his new home.

> Residents of Blocks 562 to 565 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 were told on Saturday that they could take a three-room or larger flat at the replacement site on a shorter 50-year lease, if the new flat is able to last the owners until they are 95.

> Alternatively, they can opt for the lease buyback scheme at the existing Sers flat if they are aged 65 and over.

> This is the first time that the HDB is offering four-room flats on a shorter lease.

> The new options come after residents had raised concerns about having to shell out as much as $100,000 in cash for similarly sized replacement units.

> Mr Ghazali, who occupies a 13th-floor unit with his wife, said he thinks the option of taking the 50-year lease is reasonable and the one which he is most likely to consider.

> Similarly, retired writer Pauline Dawn Loh, 65, said she is happy about the HDB's swift response to residents' concerns.

> She said: ""It would have been very difficult for us to bridge the gap in the prices between the old flats and the new flats.""

> Ms Loh, who lives with her husband who is also a retired writer, said the price difference between their current 82 sq m corner three-room flat and a slightly smaller 80 sq m four-room flat in the new block is estimated to be about $80,000.

> Streaming in as early as 4.30pm, the pupils screamed in delight as various elements of the parade made their appearances. Many of the children held up their phones to capture the action.

> These included aerobatic displays by F-16 fighter jets, landings by the Red Lions parachutists, and a security operations demonstration by the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team called the Total Defence Display.

> Among the Primary 5 pupils in attendance was Chai Rui Jia from Kranji Primary. The 11-year-old was looking forward to the parachutists as there was ""suspense on whether they can land in the right area"".

> It was the first time watching the parade in person for many of the pupils, including Saravanabhava Sonika and Mohamed Hafiz Mohamed Haneefa from Fengshan Primary. They are both 11.

> Hafiz told The Straits Times: ""I feel lucky to be part of the batch that is able to watch the NE Show in person, as some of my friends had to miss it in the past two years.""

> Saturday's rehearsal was the first of three NE shows to be held for the NDP, which is returning to its usual, centralised format. Organisers are aiming to fill up to 26,000 seats at the floating platform.

> Pandemic restrictions in the past two years had meant that the Aug 9 bash had to be scaled down.

> Before Saturday (July 2), the NE Show was last held in 2019.

> Highlights this year include a segment marking the contributions of national servicemen, with this year being the 55th anniversary of national service.

> The show segment - helmed by first-time creative director and theatre veteran Adrian Pang - consists of five chapters and a film. It aims to depict how Singapore battled the pandemic and emerged from it.

> In a statement, Mr Tan Kean Loong, assistant director of the Ministry of Education's Student Development Curriculum Division 1, said that the NE shows are a key cohort experience for Primary 5 pupils to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean.

> He added: ""Through this collective experience, we are also going to have a deepened appreciation of what we can do as a nation and how we can forge ahead, as a nation, in the future.""

670,ieklcqd,t3_vpr2u9,2vx2xcyw,t3_vpr2u9,"> # 'A single hanging of a drug trafficker is a tragedy; a million deaths from drug abuse is a statistic'

> Stephen Sackur: You are Home Affairs Minister, you have been for some time, as well as being Law Minister. Singapore is very well known around the world for its, many would say, draconian criminal code, and particularly when it comes to drugs, narcotics and the bringing of drugs into Singapore - you have a mandatory death penalty for that particular crime. Do you have any doubts at all, that that is the right policy?

> Minister: I don't have any doubts. Capital punishment is one aspect of a whole series of measures that we have, to deal with the drug abuse problem. It's imposed on drug traffickers, and it's imposed because there's clear evidence that it is a serious deterrent for would-be drug traffickers. The trafficker wants to make money. He, you know, is damaging the lives of drug users, their families - damaged, often seriously destroyed. You look at the devastating impact of drugs worldwide. WHO (World Health Organisation) report 2021: 500,000 people died, linked to drug abuse, in just one year. More than 70 per cent of that was linked to opioid abuse. United States: more than 100,000 deaths due to drug overdose in the year ended April 2021. Life expectancy in the US declined for the first time in 2015 since World War I, due in large part to the opioid crisis. I don't think enough attention has been paid...

> Stephen Sackur: Let me stop you, Minister, just for a second, because you said some very important things that I just wanted to dig into a little bit. You framed the whole thing in terms of an effort to crack down on traffickers, on the big business of illegal drugs across the world. No question. It's a very serious problem. But the fact is that one of those high-profile cases that your system has dealt with in the last few months is that of an individual from Malaysia, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who was caught with the equivalent of three tablespoonfuls of heroin as he entered Singapore. He had an IQ of 69. Medical experts say that represents intellectual disability, and after more than a decade on death row, you hanged him. Does that seem proportionate and compassionate to you?

> Minister: You've got your facts wrong. The courts found that he had the workings of a criminal mind, and he made a deliberate, purposeful, calibrated, calculated decision to make money, to bring the drugs in. The psychiatrist called by the defence agreed and confirmed that he was not intellectually disabled. And last year when his final appeal was dismissed, at the same time in October 2021, the US executed two men whose lawyers argued that they were similarly intellectually disabled. They had similar IQs, same range, somewhere between 64 and 72, 63 and 95. The courts, the US Supreme Court in one instance, upheld the executions. The men knew what they were doing for those reasons. Now, I don't see the BBC...

> Stephen Sackur: Surely you should be holding yourself to a universally high standard? You are a minister who has talked about making sure that compassion is at the centre of the judicial system in Singapore. So, it's no good pointing to other countries which may have their own flaws. I'm asking you to look at this on its merits.

> Minister: On its merits, this is the point I will make. This is a man who brought in drugs, in order to make money. He had the workings of a criminal mind. His own psychiatrist confirmed that he was not intellectually disabled.

> And look at the context: we are talking about saving lives. What do I mean? In the 1990s, we were arresting about 6,000 people per year. Thirty years later today, there are more drugs around the region. Singapore is wealthier. Afghanistan and Myanmar are among the largest producers of drugs in the world. We are a logistics centre. We would be completely swamped. The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) said that this place is swimming in meth and a record haul of one billion meth tablets were seized in South-east Asia. We are in that situation.

> Stephen Sackur: I believe I'm right in saying, minister, you have about 60 people on death row at the moment, don't you, and the vast majority of them we know are convicted of drug offences?

> Minister: We do, but we have also saved thousands of lives. Because we are now arresting about 3,000 people per year. That's 3,000 people...

> Stephen Sackur: The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network says Singapore's international reputation has deteriorated significantly as the result of things like the execution of this individual, Nagaenthran. That's what you have to confront. Are you prepared to see your state's reputation sink because of the draconian decisions you insist on making?

> Minister: I think the key thing is the lives of Singaporeans and protecting Singaporeans. You know, people focus on, and the BBC focuses on, this one person. You ran four articles (on this case) from October of last year to March of this year. One of them was the headline, overtaking the Ukraine war. But you haven't run any article on what the UNODC said about the severe situation in South-east Asia. And what about the thousands of lives that are at stake from drug trafficking? You know, we're not even talking about Mexico.

> Before we move on, let me just make this point, Mr Sackur. I think the media reporting and all the things that you've quoted, make this point - that a single hanging of a drug trafficker, to misquote a well-known quote - a single hanging of a drug trafficker is a tragedy; a million deaths from drug abuse is a statistic. I think that's what this shows.

> This comes as the nation is facing a serious dengue situation. Close to 18,000 cases have been reported so far this year, over three times the 5,258 cases last year.

> In the first half of this year, about 389,000 dengue inspections were conducted islandwide, with the National Environment Agency (NEA) uncovering about 10,800 mosquito breeding habitats.

> About half of the breeding habitats of the Aedes mosquito - which spreads the dengue virus - detected across the island have been in homes, with the figure rising to 60 per cent in dengue cluster areas, NEA said in a joint statement with the People's Association (PA) on Saturday (July 2).

> A total of 1,173 cases were reported in the week from June 19 to 25, NEA said.

> ""Although the numbers in recent weeks have shown a decline, the risk of transmission remains high as there are still more than 300 dengue clusters across the island. The weekly number of cases is still very high, exceeding 1,000 cases, and we are in the early months of the traditional peak dengue season in Singapore,"" NEA said.

> As the nation ramps up its fight against dengue, some 5,000 volunteers from the PA grassroots organisations and PA Community Emergency Response Team (Cert) will join NEA's SG Clean Ambassadors in conducting house visits in dengue cluster areas over the next two weeks.

> They will be sharing information and tips with residents on how to prevent mosquito breeding and how to better protect themselves.

> These complement ongoing house and ground inspections by NEA officers.

> On Saturday (July 2), Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng joined PA volunteers visiting homes at Boon Lay Drive to urge residents to remove stagnant water and potential mosquito breeding habitats, as well as take proactive measures to prevent dengue cases in the neighbourhood.

> Boon Lay is an active dengue cluster area.

> Mr Baey also thanked the volunteers for their support in ramping up dengue prevention awareness to stem the surge in dengue cases.

Ofc the dance floor was packed like sardines, there were a lot of people jostling about. You're supposed to be masked up in there (which a majority do) but quite a lot of people don't anyway. The crowd/mask control people are generally only diligent to those in their areas, i.e. those they don't notice, they don't catch. They were at least also punishing vapers, some dude in front of me barely took a puff and the guard immediately escorted him off (Though, of course, I saw a lot of people who didn't get caught vaping regardless becuse the guards weren't really actively searching for those). Off the dance floor a lot of people were holding drinks and unmasked, no staff really cared about those.

The decent part: Marquee has a big area; there's 3 stories. That means apart from the crowded-af-dancefloor you're still going to be able to find some more open space with less crowd, such as near the various bars counters or near the entrance. There's also, well, the whole ferris wheel thing where you can get a decent amount of time to yourself and your friends. Quite a lot of places to hop on and just sit down and chill (not seats, but low counters). A large range of demographics there for sure because it's Marquee, but a lot of people I find were content with just chilling and vibing with the music.

Witnessed toh casualties: A lot, but those that really needed it were decently taken care of by staff. 

Witnessed pukes: At least 4, definitely more. Avoid being under railings.

Witnessed bargirl alcohol parades having to sashay past casualties: 2.

> “We do a proper test and we also assess for the complications of COVID-19. That's why it's very important to see your doctor,” he advised.

> Dr Cheng said that people who test positive but are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms can recover at home, according to Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines.

> “If they are unwell, they are advised to see a doctor,” he said.

> MORE REINFECTIONS?

> While studies and data overseas have reported more breakthrough infections due to BA.4 and BA.5, clinics here have not seen a clear trend of this happening in Singapore.

> “But do keep in mind that we have not reached the peak of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariant wave yet,” said Dr Cheng.

> Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director of the Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said that the rate of reinfection with BA.4 and BA.5 is still low.

> “The problem with BA.4 and BA.5 is that they are more transmissible but not necessarily more virulent. This happens with all pandemic viruses. They become more transmissible and less virulent over time,” said Prof Tambyah.

> Associate Professor Natasha Howard from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS said that people who have been fully vaccinated and boosted or recently had COVID-19 can still get infected.

> “Unless you can avoid people entirely, and most of us wouldn’t want to, it will be almost impossible to avoid any COVID infection (or reinfection) as we adjust to endemicity,” she said.

> “This is why we so strongly recommend being fully vaccinated and getting boosted once you’re eligible. If you are fully vaccinated you are less likely to experience severe disease.”

> BOOSTER VACCINATIONS

> Dr Zhang, whose Bishan clinic offers vaccinations, has also noticed more people enquiring about and taking booster jabs.

> ""We do see quite a lot of people asking and walking in for vaccinations, which is quite heartening and which we strongly encourage,"" he said.

> For those who are concerned about reinfection, they should still get their booster vaccination 90 days following recovery, said the Fullerton Health spokesperson.

> Assoc Prof Howard said that most seniors should take an mRNA vaccine as a booster, unless they are medically ineligible, in which case they can take Novavax's Nuvaxovid.

> “While these don’t specifically target BA.4/5 subvariants they still provide good protection against severe infection,” she said.

> Booster vaccine candidates in the pipeline, such as Moderna's bivalent booster candidate (mRNA-1273.214) that showed a good response against BA.4 and BA.5, are not yet approved for use.

> The prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are also expected to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region. This monsoon season typically extends into September and is a drier period compared with other times of the year.

> The daily maximum temperature in July is forecast to be between 33 deg C and 34 deg C, slightly higher than the 32 deg C to 34 deg C on many days in June.

> SINGAPORE - Fuel pump prices have dipped across several brands - the first time since April.

> According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1).

> Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales.

> The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon.

> With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec).

> The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex).

> Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell).

> The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest.

> After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card).

> Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations.

> For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card).

> Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week.

> RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month.

> Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions.

> Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand.

> Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire.

> But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices.

> Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits.

> According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade.

> Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year.

> SINGAPORE - He went on online shopping platform Taobao to buy replica guns, wanting to keep them for himself or resell them online.

> A police investigation later found Tan Yan Rong with 19 replica guns and that he had sold at least 16 other similar weapons.

> The 20-year-old was convicted on Friday (July 1) after he pleaded guilty to a charge under the Arms and Explosives Act. Another charge under the same Act will be taken into consideration during sentencing on Aug 10.

> The court called for a report to assess the tertiary student's suitability for probation and also for one to assess his suitability for reformative training.

> Offenders given reformative training will be detained in a centre and made to follow a strict regimen that can include foot drills as well as counselling.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Suhas Malhotra told the court that on Sept 7, 2020, at about 3.30pm, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) reported to the police that it had detected four sets of airsoft guns while conducting an operation at Lam Soon Industrial Building in Hillview Avenue.

> In the course of investigations, a consignment note containing Tan's address was found along with three plastic toy rifles and a plastic toy revolver inside a container.

> On the same day that ICA made the report, Tan was arrested on suspicion of having committed offences under the Arms and Explosives Act.

> At about 10pm that day, the 19 replica guns were found in Tan's home and seized.

> Among them were a plastic toy replica MP5 rifle and a plastic toy replica submachine gun, both of which are battery-operated and spring-powered, and capable of shooting 8mm water-absorbent pellets.

> All 19 guns were assessed by ST Engineering Synthesis to be capable of shooting the pellets and thus are ""arms"" as defined in the Arms and Explosive Act, said Mr Suhas, adding that Tan was not authorised to possess them.

> The DPP added: ""The accused purchased such toy replica guns either to keep or to resell to local buyers via the online sales platform Carousell.

> ""If the latter, the accused would deliver the purchased items to the buyer in person, and accept cash on delivery or payment via PayNow.""

> Tan admitted to buying toy replica guns online from around 2018 or 2019 to a couple of weeks before his arrest.

> Some records retrieved by investigators from his WeChat and Taobao logs showed that he had at least five customers from March to September 2020 to whom he had sold at least 16 toy replica guns and accompanying accessories.

> Each gun was sold for between $100 and $620.

> Tan was represented by lawyers Josephus Tan, Cory Wong and Josiah Zee from Invictus Law Corporation.

> In their written mitigation plea, they said Tan is academically inclined and had done well in polytechnic. He was also invited to apply for early admission to Singapore Management University, which has offered a place for him to pursue a software engineering degree.

> The lawyers added: ""Admittedly, what Yan Rong had done is foolish. He had wanted to earn extra money to ease the financial burden on his parents.

> ""Unable to find a part-time job that suits his schedule without affecting his studies, he decided to do what he did and he now knows that what he did was wrong.""

> For the illegal possession of arms, Tan can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to three years.

> SINGAPORE: Eligible past and present national servicemen (NSmen) will receive S$100 of digital credits from Friday (Jul 1).

> The credits are part of the NS55 Recognition Package, meant to thank NSmen for their contributions to Singapore’s defence and security as the country marks 55 years of National Service.

> The NS55 Recognition Package also includes a one-year complimentary SAFRA or HomeTeamNS principal membership.

> Here’s what you need to know about how to redeem the package and how to use the credits.

> Q: Who is eligible for the NS55 credits?

> NSmen will be eligible for the package based on their national service status as of May this year.

> This includes full-time national servicemen (NSFs), those who are or were operationally ready NSmen, and NSFs who are disrupted from full-time National Service.

> NSFs who enlist by Dec 31 this year will also qualify for the benefits after enlistment, said the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).

> All eligible NSmen will receive their NS55 Recognition Package notification at the official address on their NRIC. The letter will contain instructions on how to register for the SAFRA/HomeTeamNS membership. Registration for membership closes on Dec 31, 2022.

> Q: How can I redeem the S$100 digital credits?

> From July 2022, eligible NSmen will receive an SMS notification that the NS55 credits have been disbursed to them.

> The credits, which are valid for a year, will be disbursed digitally in batches from Jul 1 to 31.

> NSmen can access their LifeSG mobile app to redeem the digital credits at any online or physical merchant accepting payment by Scan and Pay via PayNow UEN QR or NETS QR.

> Q: Can I redeem the credits in cash or physical vouchers?

> The digital credits cannot be withdrawn from SoCash like other NS credits given out previously.

> However, hardcopy vouchers can be provided to those who have “exhausted all means of assistance” but are still unable to access or redeem their credits via the LifeSG app, said MINDEF on Thursday.

> These NSmen can contact the NS55 Call Centre (1800-723-6755 or contactus [at] ns55.com.sg) to request vouchers.

> Those who need help accessing the LifeSG mobile app to redeem their credits can visit any of the SAFRA or HomeTeamNS clubhouses, or the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s SG Digital Community Hubs.

> When credits have been successfully spent, there will be a payment success screen at the end of each transaction. NSmen can also view their credit balance and past transactions on the LifeSG app.

> He was responding to a question on remarks made by Mahathir recently about reclaiming lost Malay lands, including Singapore and Indonesia's Riau Islands.

> ""I'm not sure that I need to give a response because Dr Mahathir wasn't talking to us... He's a known entity, is respected as an elder and he has dealt with previous prime ministers, including (Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong),"" he was quoted as saying by The Straits Times.

> He later added, ""You have to take a few breaths and give him the respect that he is due. He says it for different audiences, and he himself said that those comments were not for us, so we should just take it at face value.""

> Last week, Mahathir, who is Member of Parliament for Langkawi, sparked controversy with neighbours Singapore and Indonesia for his comments on Malay lands.

> In a speech on 19 June which was uploaded online, he said that Malay lands stretched from the Isthmus of Kra in southern Thailand to the Riau Islands.

> ""We should demand not just that Pedra Branca, or Pulau Batu Puteh, be returned to us, instead we should also demand for the return of Singapore and the Riau Islands to Malaysia as Malay lands,"" he said.

> ""But today, we are left with only the peninsula... I wonder whether we will continue to own this peninsula. I am worried for the future of Malays, whether the peninsula land will also be owned by another party,"" he added.

> Three days later, Indonesia's foreign ministry rebutted the claim on the Riau Islands, saying there was no legal basis for it.

> ""In a time when the world is facing many challenges, a senior politician should not be making baseless statements that can harm friendships,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman.

> A day later, Mahathir claimed his comments were taken out of context.

> ""I am not asking Malaysia to claim the land that we had lost,"" he said. ""I am trying to point out that we are so concerned over losing a table-size rock but never about bigger parts of Malaysia when they were taken from us.""

> Separately, Mahathir - who turns 97 on 10 July - said on Wednesday that he may defend his parliament seat at the next general election, which must be called by September next year, if there are no suitable candidates from his Pejuang party.

> He had in March said that he would not contest the next election due to age and health, having been hospitalised for a month early this year for an elective medical procedure.

> In 2019, they analysed data from 875 Primary 6 pupils enrolled in Malay/Muslim self-help group Yayasan Mendaki's tuition scheme and used cluster analysis to group the pupils into two blocs.

> Cluster analysis is a process which groups subjects with similar traits and characteristics together to form ""clusters"".

> The researchers found that the pupils fell into two clusters, with pupils in the first having better PSLE scores, and pupils in the second doing worse.

> Pupils in the first group also tended to be of a relatively higher socio-economic status, while those with indicators related to having a lower socio-economic platform tended to perform worse.

> Some of the indicators of socio-economic status that the researchers used were the type of residence, whether or not the pupil lived in a rental block, and the household's per person income.

> An extension of this pilot study was conducted three years later, also by SUSS, looking at 2,541 primary-level pupils.

> The pupils fell into three clusters, whose characteristics followed those identified in the first study.

> Pupils in the first cluster had a higher household per capita income, a lower rate of living in rental housing and a smaller household size. They also did better in literacy and numeracy.

Property is often used as a hedge against high inflation. Property prices often go up during high inflation environments. From the buyer's perspective, if I don't buy now, 3 years later my money will be weaker and property prices will be even higher. Coupled with the following problems:  
\- huge increase in manpower and raw materials cost   
\- backlog in construction  
\- very high demand   
\- Relatively ""low"" interest rate now (US FED will continue to raise rates higher, buy now and lock it in fix rate NOW.)  
It creates a ""get on the train now or missed it"" mentality. Buyers know prices are high now, but to wait means paying for more later. Personally, I don't think the Gov has a lot room to stop this. They have pushed cooling measures to the max and it only put a dent in demand.

> SINGAPORE - Beleaguered Singapore-based crypto firm Three Arrows Capital is now facing censure from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on top of its considerable financial woes.

> Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, was reprimanded by the MAS on Thursday (June 30) for providing false information and for managing more assets than it was allowed to under Singapore rules.

> The regulator listed three breaches by the crypto hedge fund relating to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations.

> The first was for providing misleading information. 3AC told the MAS it had moved the management of its fund to an unrelated offshore entity last September. But this representation was misleading as Mr Zhu Su, who is a 3AC co-founder and director, was a common shareholder of both 3AC and the offshore entity.

> The second breach was 3AC's failure to notify the MAS of changes to directorships and shareholdings of Mr Zhu and co-founder Kyle Davies within a required timeline.

> The third is that 3AC exceeded the assets under management (AUM) threshold of $250 million between July and September 2020 and between November 2020 and August 2021.

> 3AC, which obtained its registered fund management company status from the MAS in August 2013, was allowed to serve up to 30 qualified investors and manage assets of no more than $250 million.

> Last September, 3AC transferred management of the only fund it managed to an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands, where it is incorporated.

> It resumed management of a portion of the fund's assets in February but told the MAS on April 29 that it intended to cease fund management activity in Singapore from May 6.

> The MAS signalled that its investigations, which started in June last year, are not over: ""In light of recent developments which call into question the solvency of the fund managed by 3AC, MAS is assessing if there were further breaches by 3AC of MAS regulations.""

> SINGAPORE - The number of reported suicides in the Republic fell to 378 last year, down 16.3 per cent from 2020.

> Figures from Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) showed that suicide deaths among those aged 60 and above also declined, from 154 two years ago to 112 in 2021.

> In a media statement on Friday (July 1), SOS attributed this to efforts by the authorities - together with the mental health sector and the community - to prioritise mental well-being and suicide prevention in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.

> The non-profit suicide prevention centre noted, however, that suicide remains the cause of the most number of deaths among people aged 10 to 29 for the past three years.

> Deaths among this age group rose to 29.6 per cent of all suicides recorded here last year, SOS said, up from 22.3 per cent in 2020.

> Among those aged between 10 and 19, suicide rose by 23.3 per cent - from 30 deaths in 2020 to 37 last year.

> SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said the overall decrease in number was encouraging, noting that more people are seeking help.

> ""Comparing 2020 with 2021, our crisis hotline has seen a 127 per cent increase in calls from young people aged 10 to 19, expressing a strong cry for help that cannot be ignored,"" he said.

> He noted that demand has grown for the group's text messaging service, SOS CareText.

> Data is not available for SOS CareText, which was launched in 2020 and expanded into a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week service this year.

> Noting that it had introduced various youth-oriented programmes over the years, SOS called for greater effort to enhance and expand current initiatives to tackle suicide among youth.

> Dr Jared Ng, senior consultant and chief of the Institute of Mental Health's Department of Emergency and Crisis Care, said: ""Young patients we encountered have been reporting various stressors in their lives, such as interpersonal issues with their family and friends, academic stress, achievement stress and future job stress.""

> Preventing youth suicides requires coordination among various sectors - such as education, social services and health - as well as support and guidance from family members and friends, Dr Ng said.

Indian and Chinese cultures focus very heavily on education and hard work. There are variations of it from family to family but in general, most Indian/Chinese parents drive their kids to succeed and will invest a lot of time and money into ensuring some form of success for them. Education tends to be the most preferred and straightforward way, especially educational qualifications. This is largely consistent no matter where they live, be it in Singapore, China, India or Chinese/Indian diaspora everywhere across the world. Same cannot really be said about the Malays. 

To go slightly off tangent, Malcolm Gladwell explored this topic to try and see why Asian kids do better than in math than Western kids. Basically attitudes of kids towards math is shaped by their cultural history and how motivated they are to push themselves.
