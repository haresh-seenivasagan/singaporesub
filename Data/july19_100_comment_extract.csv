igr8p0n,w2obkv,2vx2xcyw,"> # Strides limousine drivers upset vehicle rental fees now higher than pre-pandemic

> SINGAPORE - About 90 Strides limousine drivers now have to pay more than what they did pre-pandemic to rent their vehicles, after rates were revised upwards three times in the last two months.

> Compared to $150 per day charged before the pandemic, the drivers, who rent the Toyota Vellfire from SMRT's Strides, now have to renew their contracts at $160.50 per day.

> Drivers said they are worried this could further increase later in the year at a time when fuel costs are surging, and set a benchmark for other transport companies.

> They also said that the move was announced without any consultation, effectively ""forcing the increase down our throats"" after two years of depressed fares, including for the ferrying of Covid-19 patients in full protective gear.

> The latest increase to $160.50 per day by Strides was announced in individual messages sent to drivers on June 14, after which the company told concerned drivers that there were more than 100 people on a wait list if they chose not to renew their one- or two- year contracts.

> Before this, messages were sent on April 30 and May 17, informing drivers that their contracts would be changed, first from the subsidised $112 per day during Covid-19 to $139, then to $150.

> Despite a petition on online petition website Change.org, titled ""Stop exploiting local Singapore drivers"", and intercession of the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA), the only concession so far is to allow drivers to renew their lease at $160.50 after their current contract ends, instead of immediately from July.

> ""I understand that they are trying to recoup their Covid-19 losses and were prepared for an increase, but this is too much, especially for a car that is already three to four years old,"" said Strides driver Sherwin Tan, 40.

> ""We now have to be on the road five to six hours just to break even. They are also still getting a 20 per cent commission for our work.""

> Another Strides driver, Mr Peter Tan, said he has no choice but to stomach the increase as he is already 62. ""There might be an out for others, but not me. Now that it's the summer holidays, there are also fewer tourists in Singapore. Business is not as good as they imagine.""

> Strides' limousine service caters to private-hire and airport transfer demand, which has yet to stabilise, with passenger volume at Changi Airport still about half of 2019 levels.

> Some drivers said they had left Strides due to the hike. A 44-year-old, who quit last week and who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, said ""it's just bad treatment of drivers"".

> ""The new rental rate is on the very high side compared to other companies,"" he added. ""I've heard that it might even go up to $170 per day by September. I'm very worried that other limo leasers will follow suit.""

> Strides is the first operator to increase its rental charges after the pandemic struck, with other operators choosing so far to raise fares to protect their drivers' earnings amid changing ridership demand and increasing fuel prices.

> But this can sometimes backfire. Grab drew some flak after it cut the waiting time grace period before penalising riders from five to three minutes. It had said the move was introduced to help drivers reduce fuel wastage caused by idling engines while waiting.

> In response to The Straits Times, Strides said it had been leasing out its limousines at below market rates during Covid-19, and that it has to adjust them according ""to the market conditions as they develop"".

> The demand for point-to-point limousine services has risen and fares have also increased, its senior general manager Yeow How Pheng said.

> ""Our Strides limousine drivers are our partners and we thank them for their continuous support, especially during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic measures. We appreciate all our driver partners and will continue to work with them to improve their earnings and livelihoods.""

> The NPHVA told ST that it hopes companies can continue to consult associations to discuss and communicate planned changes that affect earnings. It said the concession that Strides made is ""acceptable"" to drivers.

> ""We will continue advocating for the rights of our workers by engaging them to understand their needs and concerns,"" it said.

> ComfortDelGro, the largest player, said in reply to ST that rental rates for its LimoCabs and MaxiCabs have not changed in the past three years, without saying how much it charges.

> Rental continues to be cheaper than what it was pre-pandemic, with a percentage of rental every day waived given the challenging circumstances.

igr5wjm,w2nqs4,2vx2xcyw,"> # MinLaw rolls out tech platform to help law firms manage cases, clients

> SINGAPORE - Lawyers can now use a new technology platform supported by the Government to manage cases, share documents with clients or colleagues, and handle billing matters.

> The Legal Technology Platform, aimed at helping Singapore law practices to streamline their day-to-day workflow, was officially rolled out at the Supreme Court on Tuesday (July 19).

> The platform is jointly developed by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and tech firm Lupl, with feedback from over 100 lawyers from various practice areas taken into consideration.

> On Tuesday, MinLaw said it would help law firms defray the initial costs of adopting the platform and other integrated legal technology tools.

> Under this funding initiative, which is supported by Enterprise Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority, eligible law firms will need to pay only $21 per user every month for the first two years, compared with the usual subscription cost of $69 per user each month.

> The platform seeks to help small and medium law practices, which may face resource constraints in adopting legal technology, with digital transformation. But it is also available for use by bigger law firms and in-house lawyers in companies.

> The platform is accessible through an Internet browser, such as Google Chrome.

> Matter templates for different types of cases, which set out details such as timelines and steps to take, are available on the platform.

> Details of a legal matter, such as its status and deadlines of tasks, will be displayed on the platform.

> Lawyers can link the platform to other digital solutions they are using, such as Google Docs, and access any documents or information stored there. The platform is also connected to popular messaging app WhatsApp, for lawyers to communicate with their clients from a single platform.

> MinLaw said there were plans to include additional features in the platform, for instance, links to other online services such as legal research portal LawNet and Supreme Court system e-litigation.

> It has set up a committee, currently comprising 10 lawyers from a range of practice areas, to provide feedback and suggest improvements to the platform.

> The ministry will also work with the Law Society of Singapore to organise a series of outreach and training events about the platform for lawyers.

> Another charge of distributing the voyeuristic recording was considered for sentencing. There is a gag order on the victim's identity.

> Between March and April, while at home, she positioned her phone camera about 1m to 2m away and started recording a video while intentionally changing the boy's pants in the middle of the camera's field of vision.

> The child's bare buttocks could be seen throughout the video, which was at least 18 seconds long, and his private parts were exposed for a few seconds.

> The maid then uploaded the video onto her TikTok account with a caption in the Indonesian language.

> The caption, translated to English, read: ""Condition for a domestic worker to be successful: Personal necessities borne by the employer, food and date borne by employer, no off day, no Shoppee (sic), whatever things I can request from employer and just believe it, go back to Indonesia with a bag full of money, not a bag full of dirty clothes!""

> Rike Kusnul Kotimah claimed that she had taken the video as a memento, court documents stated.

> The punishment for intentionally recording a child under 14 doing a private act without his or her consent is up to two years' jail and a fine or caning.

> The penalty for theft is up to seven years' jail and a fine.

igr10h0,w2kndd,44t3xcqe,"This is a weird article.

The job of the MAS is not to make profits on its forex holdings.  
Rather, the job of the MAS is to ""promote sustained non-inflationary economic growth"".

The easiest way to make a profit as a central banker is to depreciate the currency. That means our forex holdings will now be worth a whole lot more, but also means that foreign items cost more (i.e. more inflation). 

Do we really want MAS to focus on protecting its profits rather than protecting the rice bowls of Singaporeans? No right?

The question we should ask is not whether the MAS turns a profit, but rather whether the MAS is meeting its own inflation targets. According to the MAS, [core inflation of around 2%](https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/Singapores-Monetary-Policy-Framework/faqs/section-1#S01.4) is consistent with overall price stability. Yet, per the article, MAS now projects core inflation to peak at 4-4.5% later this year. Sure, this is better than US inflation (9.1% in June), but should the MAS do more to keep inflation under control? This is an open question that the article should have explored.",2022-07-19 15:33:48+08:00,56,False

Indeed, under Jamus Lim's recent proposal for MAS to strengthen the Singdollar more rapidly to further protect households from inflation (which I have no strong opinions about), the size of this ""loss"" by MAS would have been even larger (because their foreign exchange reserves would be worth even less in Singdollar terms).

Besides, since central banks can (in theory at least) will however much of their currency they want into existence, and so (again, in theory at least) reflect whatever profit and loss numbers they want (in local currency terms), this headline is just not very meaningful at all.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore's financial sector went from strength to strength, buoyed by broad-based growth but inflationary pressures, wobbly global growth and global tightening monetary policies have weighed on the central bank's fiscal performance.

> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Tuesday (July 19) announced at its annual review that it clocked a net loss of $7.4 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 - the first time in nine years.

> The loss came from lower investment gains, a large negative foreign exchange translation effect, and higher interest expenses.

> As a result of the loss, MAS did not contribute to Singapore's consolidated fund, out of which government expenditure is made, for the financial year. It had contributed $1.07 billion in fiscal 2021 and $2.17 billion in 2020.

> MAS also said that as at end-March, Singapore's official foreign reserves recorded a net loss of $4.7 billion as investment gains of $4 billion were more than offset by the strengthening of the Singapore dollar, which led to a negative foreign exchange translation effect of $8.7 billion.

> The Singdollar strengthened 4 per cent against the British pound, 5 per cent against the euro, and 9 per cent against the Japanese yen, MAS noted.

> The investment returns from Singapore's reserves supplement its Budget spending. The Government can spend up to 50 per cent of the expected long-term investment returns generated by MAS, GIC and Temasek Holdings – the three entities tasked to manage the reserves.

> MAS’ total expenditure for the year increased, to $2.8 billion, due mainly to higher interest expenses on domestic money market operations.

> The central bank has been gradually tightening monetary policy since Oct 2021, as inflation continues to rise. A stronger exchange rate makes imports cheaper. It can also decrease Singapore’s exports, dampening economic growth. Both effects can also reduce the pressure to raise wages.

> In July, MAS further tightened monetary policy in its second off-cycle move this year.

> MAS managing director Ravi Menon said on Tuesday that core inflation is projected to increase to a peak of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent in the third quarter this year before levelling off to 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent by year end, much higher than what Singapore is used to. Core inflation excludes housing rents and private transport costs.

> ""If there are fresh shocks to global energy and food supplies arising from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or a significant overheating of the domestic labour market, inflation may end up being higher and more persistent,"" he said.

> Senior Minister and MAS chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in the report that the central bank had tightened monetary policy four times since Oct 2021 to help ensure medium-term price stability, amid sustained growth in the economy.

> ""These moves should slow the inflation momentum but cannot fully mitigate the pass-through of higher global inflation, especially in food and energy prices.

> ""The domestic labour market is tight and some pickup in consumer services inflation is to be expected. However, MAS expects core inflation to stabilise by the latter part of the year,"" he added.

> On Tuesday (July 19), High Court judge Tan Siong Thye said Ms Serene Tiong failed to establish her claim that she suffered harm as a result of negligence by Dr Chan Herng Nieng.

> Justice Tan said Ms Tiong's claim that Dr Chan had given her 280 tablets starting from May 2017 was not supported by contemporaneous text messages exchanged between them over a period of more than a year.

> On the other hand, Dr Chan's version of events - that he gave Ms Tiong 14 tablets for short-term use - was more consistent with the evidence.

> ""Ms Tiong's claim that she suffered side effects due to consuming high dosages of Xanax and a lifelong Xanax dependency caused by Dr Chan's negligence is clearly unsupported by the evidence,"" said the judge.

> The judge added that Ms Tiong also failed to prove her claim that Dr Chan had caused her psychiatric harm by misleading her into thinking that he was committed to having a long-term and exclusive sexual relationship with her.

> Justice Tan said the current case was the latest episode in Ms Tiong's plot for revenge against the one who spurned her.

> The negligence suit is the latest legal action triggered by Ms Tiong's discovery of WhatsApp messages between Dr Chan and his friend, surgeon Julian Ong, in which the two men boasted about their sexual conquests.

> ""Indeed, the adage that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned best describes the vitriolic actions of Ms Tiong,"" he said.

> The judge added: ""Although I have ruled against Ms Tiong, Dr Chan has borne, and will continue to bear, the shame of having his wanton and depraved behaviour aired in public for all to see.""

> Justice Tan noted that Dr Chan does not dispute that he owed Ms Tiong a duty of care by virtue of his medical expertise.

> ""Dr Chan's disgraceful use of women including Ms Tiong as his sex objects and the disturbing pride with which he gloated about his sexual conquests in the WhatsApp exchanges with Dr Ong suggest that he is a person with serious and grave character defects.

> ""Dr Chan's conduct in exploiting Ms Tiong and other women for his own perverse desires is debauched, degenerate and highly deserving of censure.""

> SINGAPORE - A four year-old girl who came down with Covid-19 has died, said the Ministry of Health.

> This is the second death here caused by the virus in a patient aged below 12.

> Responding to media queries on Tuesday (July 19), MOH said that the child died from pneumonia last Sunday (July 17), and that she had no past medical history and was previously well.

> ""She developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and fever on July 15, and tested positive for Covid-19 via an antigen rapid test (ART) on Sunday at a General Practitioner clinic,"" said MOH.

> She was prescribed medications for her symptoms but remained unwell, and collapsed later that night, the ministry added.

> MOH said that the cause of death was later determined by the state coroner to be Covid-19 pneumonia.

> On June 27, a 1½-year-old boy had died from encephalitis - or inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 and two other viruses, said MOH then.

> The two viruses were the respiratory syncytial virus and the enterovirus.

> It added that the boy had no other past medical history and was previously well.

> ""Children are generally more resilient to Covid-19 infections than adults and the elderly. Notwithstanding, Covid-19 infections can result in severe disease amongst children,"" said the ministry on Tuesday.

> It added that MOH, the Health Sciences Authority and the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination are studying the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines that have been formulated for young children under the age of five.

> This comes after the United States' Food and Drug Administration had expanded the authorisations for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to include children as young as six months old earlier this year.

> The Moderna vaccine is suitable for children aged six months to five years of age whereas the Pfizer vaccine is for children aged six months to four years old.

> SINGAPORE - Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and organisations in Singapore are among the most targeted in the world, according to a recent study.

> Despite this, businesses here tend to prioritise recovery rather than prevention, said a report published last month by cyber-security technology firm Cybereason.

> Ransomware is a type of malware that typically infiltrates a computer system and encrypts the data inside. Criminals then demand a ransom, threatening to leave it locked up and inaccessible.

> Criminals are also increasingly using a ""double extortion"" tactic, where they not only encrypt the data but also steal it and threaten to leak or sell it online.

> Cybereason said Singapore businesses were witnessing the greatest volume of such attacks among the countries polled, with 80 per cent of respondents here saying their organisations had been hit by a ransomware attack in the past 24 months. Globally, the average figure was 72 per cent.

> The percentage of Singapore organisations that reported at least one attack in the past year also rose from 60 per cent in last year's report to 80 per cent this year.

> Cybereason’s field chief security officer for the Asia-Pacific region C.K. Chim said the recent ransomware “gold rush” among cyber criminals is due to the fact that it is becoming easier for criminals to carry out such attacks, while many organisations are also now more reliant on digital infrastructure than before.

> Many ransomware gangs now operate like legitimate companies with complex yet efficient business models, Mr Chim said.

> He added: “Ransomware is an extremely lucrative model with little to no risk involved for the threat actors, as they often operate in countries with no extradition treaty... This allows them to operate with near impunity.”

> The developers of the malware are increasingly opting to share their tools with “affiliates”, such as those who specialise in gaining unauthorised access to networks, in exchange for a fee or a cut of the ransom.

> Two prominent and commonly used types of ransomware, called LockBit 2.0 and Conti, operate under a “ransomware-as-a-service” model.

> Mr Chim said factors like lack of cyber hygiene as well as lack of visibility and detection of cyber criminals are overwhelming many companies’ security operations, including but not limited to those in Singapore.

> According to the study, Singapore respondents had the lowest confidence in their organisations’ ability to manage a ransomware attack. About 64 per cent said they were confident in their organisations’ people, while 61 per cent were confident in their policies.

> Respondents from Britain had the highest level of confidence in their organisations’ people and policies, at 94 per cent and 77 per cent respectively.

> “Basic cyber hygiene is lacking among employees, which is obvious when they open phishing e-mails or select insecure passwords,” Mr Chim said.

> “Preventing this may not necessarily require more budget, technology, or manpower. Instead, it requires a better understanding of how ransomware occurs and the implementation of measures that drastically reduce the ability of cyber criminals to snatch valuable data.”

> SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) said it is continuing discussions with Heathrow Airport on the potential impact of the hub's move to cap the number of passengers departing from London.

> Heathrow Airport said last week that it had decided to cap departing passengers at 100,000 a day between Jul 12 and Sep 11 to ensure passengers have a ""safe and reliable journey"", amid long queue times, baggage delays and cancellations.

> The airport also asked airlines to stop selling tickets to limit the impact on passengers.

> Responding to CNA queries on Monday (Jul 18), an SIA spokesperson said that there is currently no change to its scheduled flights from Heathrow Airport.

> ""We will update our customers as soon as possible if there are any changes to their flights or bookings,"" the spokesperson said.

> The airline also advised customers to update their contact information under their bookings to receive updates on the status of their flights.

> SIA currently operates four daily flights between Singapore and Heathrow Airport.

> Britain's busiest airport is struggling to cope as travel demand rebounds after the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Elsewhere in Europe, passenger caps have also been implemented such as in the Netherlands and Germany’s Frankfurt.

> A Singaporean man had an unfortunate trip to Genting Highlands after his Singapore-registered sports car was stolen from a car park in SkyAvenue mall on Jul. 16.

> Car goes missing

> The Singaporean man, who goes by Damien, said he had parked his car — a Honda Civic Type R, a high-performance sedan — at a car park at SkyAvenue, a mall in Resorts World Genting.

> The massive car park is also shared with First World Hotel, where Damien and his girlfriend stayed when they visited Genting over the Jul. 15 to 17 weekend with six other friends.

> The 28-year-old told Mothership he had parked his car near the lift lobby at B3A of the car park when he arrived at the hotel at around noon on Jul. 15.

> It was only the next day, Jul. 16, when he realised his car went missing after he and his friends wanted to leave the hotel to drive to the nearby Gohtong Jaya town for dinner.

> Thinking that he might have wrongly remembered where he parked his car, Damien and his friends got into another one of their cars to search for the car in the car park.

> Damien also called the car park's management to assist him in finding the car. According to Damien, they sent out five motorcycles to search the car park.

> He said he and his friends spent about two hours to comb through ""every single corner"" of the car park, to no avail.

> ""Lost items are not our problem"": First World Hotel management

> Realising then that his car might have been stolen, Damien informed First World Hotel management to see if they would be able to help.

> However, Damien said that apart from sending out the motorcycles to look for his car in the car park, the management was ""not helpful at all"".

> ""When we first reported the theft, they literally replied: Oh? Your car hilang (missing)? Report police there, lost items are not our problem,"" recounted Damien.

> The Malaysian police were also unable to find Damien's car.

> The Malaysian police checked CCTV footage, which showed Damien's car being driven down the Genting Highlands mountain at around 2:43am on Jul. 16.

> Another CCTV screenshot provided by the Malaysian police showed the thief driving Damien's car out of the SkyAvenue car park by tailgating another vehicle through the exit.

> Car showed no signs of being broken into despite being locked

> Damien said the CCTV footage of his car showed no signs that his car had been broken into, as all the doors and windows of the car appeared intact.

> Damien said he had locked the doors, and performed a manual steering lock by turning his wheel fully after parking it to prevent it from being towed.

> ""Expensive lesson learnt on behalf of all Singaporeans and car owners. Please be safe when travelling everyone!"", said Damien.

> He said that he has filed an insurance claim over his stolen car.

> Mothership has reached out to First World Hotel for comment.

$1000 - 2 nights at MBS, budget sufficient for fine dining + visiting of flower dome / art sci museum etc.
Would suggest booking on weekdays to stretch your budget. Booking Wednesday + thurs nights would be the best since you’ll be able to drink at Marquee + have a place to crash after.
If you’re game you can bring someone else to crash at your place too (can’t emphasise this enough but pls make sure there’s consent if it’s an ONS).

$1500 - same as above, except you get to call an escort. Before anyone judge, OP mentioned solo staycation so I’m assuming he’s single. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with calling an escort for a short companionship(evening to next morning) without the hassle that comes with a relationship.

> SINGAPORE - Employers with 10 or more workers will no longer have to inform the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of wage cuts taken in the name of cost-saving from Aug 1.

> This comes as average monthly notifications fell to eight on average in the first three months of this year, compared with a peak of 1,713 at the start of the circuit breaker in April 2020, MOM said.

> It instituted the reporting rule in March 2020 to monitor the pandemic impact on workers, as well as to provide timely aid to employers.

> It was a temporary measure, said MOM.

> On Aug 1, its advisory on retrenchment benefits owed to laid-off employees will also cease to take effect.

> The May 2020 advisory allowed employers leeway with payouts, such as giving lump sums to workers that they let go.

> This softened the financial strain on employers over norms laid out by the tripartite alliance, such as pro-rated payouts for retrenched workers' each year of service.

> From 198 at its highest in August 2020, the number of employers turning to this relief measure has fallen to a monthly average of eight in the first three months of this year, MOM said.

> Employers carrying out layoffs must still notify MOM within five days after informing affected staff, if the firm hires at least 10 workers.

> They can refer to the tripartite advisory on managing excess manpower and responsible retrenchment, the ministry added.

> SINGAPORE - As Singapore ramps up solar energy deployment to meet its growing clean energy needs, the issue of how to deal with solar panel waste is proving to be a challenge.

> Dr Stanley Wang, co-founder and chief executive of solar tech firm EtaVolt, estimates that up to 5,000 tonnes of photovoltaic waste could be generated within the next two years, assuming that these solar panels are not recycled properly.

> EtaVolt, a spin-off from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), works with firms to sustainably recycle their used solar panels and helps them determine when to upgrade to more efficient ones.

> Photovoltaic waste could increase exponentially in a few years' time, said Dr Wang.

> The country currently has a solar capacity of more than 630 megawatt-peak. It is aiming to ramp up solar energy deployment to at least two gigawatt-peak by 2030 as part of the Singapore Green Plan.

> Countries around the world have also been rapidly increasing their solar energy deployments amid a push for renewable energy, but this has led to solar panel waste.

> The latest report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) published in 2016 estimated that the world could face up to 78 million tonnes of photovoltaic waste by 2050.

> Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, the executive director of the Energy Research Institute @ Nanyang Technological University (ERI@N), said cities like Singapore primarily deploy solar panels on rooftops.

> As newer technologies become available, it makes sense for customers to upgrade their solar panels to higher-efficiency ones, said Prof Subodh.

> Dr Wang said that while high-quality solar panels could have a lifespan of around 20 to 25 years, they are generally about 10 per cent to 15 per cent less efficient beyond the 10-year mark.

> Thus, those deploying solar panels now would be looking to have them replaced in seven to 10 years, said Prof Subodh.

> Dr Wang said the lifespan of solar panels could also be shortened if they are damaged during transportation and installation, and in lightning strikes.

> ""Given that Singapore's solar panel deployment started to pick up over the past five years, we expect significant solar panel replacement or recycling to increase significantly by 2025,"" said Prof Subodh.

Just elitist, arrogant, crappy beliefs held by many students that just because they have academic skills they are superior to everyone else and have the right to degrade them.

It doesn't surprise me then that they spread their hatred to any marginalised groups that are easy targets.

Let me make it more clear. In my time studying at one of these ""top"" schools, I have never seen people who were more racist, sexist, bigoted, and/or outright jerks than some of the students there. And the vast majority were complicit or even encouraged them. Then the same people put on their mask and pretended to be oh-so-tolerant of others during class debates or assignments. Afterwards? Bullying, jokes abt the social outcasts, insulting the intelligence of anyone deemed ""inferior"" (neighbourhood sch students, certain races etc.)

Well, I've seen their true colours. If it was not for the risk of revealing too much personal information, I could go into detail for hours on how these schools create the most toxic, elitist culture I have witnessed.

> Here is a translation of what the student said in the video in Mandarin:

> This could be the messiest and dirtiest place in Singapore. I came to Singapore's Chinatown recently. Following the reopening after the pandemic, it got more congested, and the hygiene level has become intolerable. I can't imagine how this area is still considered part of the world-renowned garden city. Every country will have areas that have shortcomings in cleanliness, which can be challenging when trying to maintain a certain level of hygiene, but Chinatown in Singapore is beyond just a shortcoming in hygiene standards. In Singapore, Chinatown here has become synonymous with dirty and messy. Previously, I was living in New York, Chinatown in Manhattan has also come to represent mess and rubbish. Chinatown is actually a window for people to understand China. It is a place for overseas Chinese to interact with one another and feel at home. It is a place of significance in the hearts of Chinese. My friends from school will hang out in Chinatown to eat as the cuisine and delicacies are authentic. To see Chinatown in Singapore become a degraded and dirty environment, I do not understand. I only have one saying to go by: When overseas, let us be conscious of our own behaviour.

> What video showed

> The video showed scenes of Singapore's Chinatown and the state of its public walkways, open spaces, eateries, and hawker centre.

> The sights were not pretty and appeared chaotic.

> Besides general litter on the ground, the video showed used plastic cups with straws placed on the sidewalk with a discarded mask and napkins stuffed into them, as well as cigarette butts.

> On the ground at an eatery were discarded glass bottles, plastic bags, and utensils.

> An appeal to fellow Chinese

> The video's appeal to fellow Chinese to mind their habits drew strong responses.

> Many of the comments expressed disappointment at the state of Chinatown here and singled out the culprits.

> The highest rated comment read: ""You know who are the culprits. Habits and character are hard to change even after leaving behind your homeland."" [""你应该知道是哪个做的。习惯、性格。。。就算离乡背景也改不了。""]

> Singaporeans who have been to Chinatown here will note that it is a favourite haunt of some locals as well.

> As to whether the video maker was also appealing to local Chinese to mind their habits, he did not explicitly say so.

> And if that was his intention, it appeared vague, as he was talking about Chinatown's significance everywhere in the world for overseas Chinese.

Doesn't seem to isolate into looking at men who **only do the butt stuff**. That's right. No statistic of heterosexuals **explicitly getting pegged!** Or eggplant touching only! Now we have the internet telling us about douching sex ed. I'd toss this statistic in the bin, it's a statistic that's strictly for that era.

[2nd one is related to a study published in 1992.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1556756/) I could not access the testing methodology. This study was done in the context of crunching sexual development and abuses into pure numerical data. Important: **this study only looks at convicted offenders, and exists as 1 part in the entirety of that collection of study.** The rest looks at issues starting from women, martial settings and abuse etc. It's unreliable on its own and is written as *exploratory*, meaning it's far too shallow to take at face value. It doesn't account for other acting factors such as trauma or shitty parents/society. Take this at face value = LOL

I turned off my brain until that 78% of homosexuals have STD statistic. Motherfucker. [~~This was cited from a pool of people who are already walking into a STD clinic in Tel Aviv~~](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22675852/)~~. You sack of shites~~ **~~you can't even get a control group right.~~** (Alright I done goofed on this one. I googled 78% and it let me here as a result of 78% heterosexuals being in the text. Ignore ignore)

Thanks to u/shimmynywimminy I found the actual source. **It's worse.** It's a [book written by Enrique Rueda](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815957157/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) published in **1982/1986**, who doesn't appear to be an academic. That's right folks it's **not even a study**, it's in fact actually a **680** pages book from a raging homophobe, which according to [this amazon review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22XXXZSQADU0F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815957157), had a lot of things to say. For the sake of brevity, the writer suggests that, homosexuals are sinful, that his CATHOLIC CHURCH would be under fire for him speaking the truth. The cherry on the frothing cake -- he suggests that the gay agenda is out to establish a female controlled homosexual society where MALES would be fuckin' LIQUIDATED by abortion and the few remaining males would be used as spermatozoa sources for future implantation. (No really **I swear I'm not making this shit up.** Also funny how it sounds like the Great Replacement Theory doesn't it?!)

Anyway because it's not a study, **I was not able to access the testing methodology** behind this 78% statistic from a catholic guy who has some talent for writing some crazy dystopian shit, and clearly, not an academic in any way.

Disclaimer: no hi-res version was available when I posted this, so the 1st 2 are the closest academic study I could find relating to those statistics. Obviously even then it's flawed.

> SINGAPORE - All fuel pump prices have fallen since Esso initiated a sharp 14-cent cut in rates last week.

> According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, the other four brands - Caltex, Shell, Sinopec and SPC - adjusted their posted prices downwards over the weekend.

> All matched Esso's reduction of 14 cents for petrol and four cents for diesel, except for SPC, which cut diesel price by seven cents and petrol prices by 16 cents a litre.

> With the change, diesel now ranges from $2.93 (SPC) to $2.98 (Caltex, Shell), and 92-octane petrol ranges from $2.94 (SPC) to $2.96 (Caltex, Esso) - the first time that all brands of 92-octane fuel are below $3 since April.

> This also means 92-octane fuels from Caltex and Esso are priced below their diesel rates - an uncommon occurrence since diesel, which attracts a far lower duty, has traditionally been noticeably less costly than the least expensive petrol here.

> Shell and Sinopec do not offer 92-octane fuel.

> The popular 95-octane grade is $3.01 across all brands except SPC, which is pricing it at $2.98. The 98-octane grade, necessary only for a minority of cars here, is now between $3.46 (SPC) and $3.50 (Shell).

> The so-called premium grade of 98-octane petrol is now between $3.50 (Shell) and $3.65 (Caltex).

> After discount, the lowest price for 92-octane petrol is $2.43 a litre from Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card). The highest is $2.55 from Esso (Citibank Cashback card and other OCBC cards).

> For 95-octane, Sinopec's $2.36 (OCBC cards) is the lowest, but it has only three stations. Among operators with a sizeable network, Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card) offer the lowest rate of $2.47 a litre. The highest 95-octane rate is $2.59 (Shell, with cards other than UOB One card) and Esso (Citibank Cashback card and OCBC cards except for OCBC 365 card).

> For 98-octane, Sinopec again has the lowest rate of $2.74 (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $2.85 (DBS Esso card). The highest rate is $3.01, posted by Shell (various Citibank and HSBC cards).

> The pump price adjustment came on the back of Brent crude oil futures tumbling below US$100 a barrel for the first time since April. RBOB gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, is hovering at around US$3.20 a gallon, the lowest in more than three months.

> Growing inflation and rising interest rates are fuelling fears of a global recession, which dampens demand for oil. Motorists have also been cutting back on mileage clocked in response to steep pump prices, while a gradual shift to electric vehicles is also crimping fuel demand.

> During the arrest of the suspect, a 19-year-old man was also arrested for the offence of harbouring an offender.

This. It can usually be boiled down to those who are used to being in the office not wanting to adapt to the times. Everyone has laptops. We all have high speed Internet. Most services or tasks can be done remotely.

If your job doesn't require you to physically work on something, there is no real need for an office. As someone whose worked in a small team of folks who are all over the world, it's actually quite simple to just randomly chat and chill with your co-workers online.

> SINGAPORE - The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board will be standardising its sender ID for SMSes from Aug 1, amid a spike in the number of phishing scams.

> It said on Monday (July 18) that it will send SMSes using only the sender ID ""CPF Board"" on matters pertaining to CPF, Workfare and Silver Support.

> It added that it will stop using the sender IDs ""SG-Workfare"" and ""SG-SSS"".

> To prevent scammers from impersonating the board by sending SMSes using the ""CPF Board"" sender ID, it has also registered this sender ID with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR), set up by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.

> Registering with SSIR identifies and blocks spoofed messages upfront, said the CPF, and only legitimate SMSes will be delivered using the new sender ID.

> ""Members can be assured that all SMSes from sender ID ""CPF Board"" are legitimate messages from us,"" said the CPF Board.

> "" CPF members who have registered their mobile numbers with us will receive an SMS from Wednesday (July 20) on this change. We encourage members to retain this SMS on their mobile phones so that (they) can be assured that any future SMSes received on this same sender ID would be legitimate,"" it added.

> Any SMSes purporting to be sent by CPF Board on any other sender ID should be ignored and deleted.

> In April, the board said an SMS sent to CPF members informing them that their ElderShield insurance policies have been terminated is legitimate, after netizens questioned its legitimacy on social media.

> The SMS had a clickable link directing people to a website about CareShield Life, which replaces ElderShield, with an instruction to log in with their Singpass for more details.

> ""The message is meant to notify CPF members that they are enrolled in CareShield Life, and that their ElderShield policies are being terminated,"" said the board then in response to queries.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore deeply feels the impact of major global moves as it is a small and open nation, and it is crucial for it to have a voice at forums like the Group of 20 (G-20), said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday (July 17).

> ""When I attend these fora, I always keep in mind why I am here, and why I update everyone on what I do - on social media and more. It must always be for Singaporeans,"" he said in a Facebook post.

> ""It is important that we keep faith with our people, and work to advance Singapore's interests on an international level,"" he added.

> Mr Wong was in Bali from Thursday to Saturday to attend the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting chaired by Indonesia, which holds the rotating presidency of the G-20 this year.

> It is the third such meeting of finance ministers this year, following one in Jakarta in February and another in Washington in April.

> In his post, Mr Wong said all countries, including Singapore, are being hit by big shocks such as Covid-19 and the Ukraine war and its impact on the economy and prices, especially for energy and food.

> He also cited rising geopolitical tensions and the erosion of the rules-based multilateral system that has served countries well for so many decades.

> Having a seat at a forum such as the G-20 is important for Singapore as it allows the country to have its voice heard when the world's largest economies discuss global matters, he said.

> ""It helps us build stronger ties with our counterparts, so we understand each other better. And with a strongly coordinated global response, we can work towards solving the most pressing issues of our time,"" said Mr Wong.

> Singapore is not a member of the G-20, which brings together the world's largest economies, including the United States, China, Japan, India, Indonesia and Russia as well as the European Union.

> However, the Republic has been invited to take part in many past G-20 summits and related meetings as the convenor of the Global Governance Group (3G), which is an informal grouping of 30 small and medium-sized members of the United Nations.

> The 3G was established by Singapore in 2009 and aims to promote greater dialogue between the G-20 and the broader UN membership.

> Mr Wong added in his Facebook post that the journey ahead in the global environment will be bumpy, with more shocks ahead.

> ""But I know that by keeping the faith, and having trust in each other, we can sail through together - a stronger Singapore,"" he said.

> Why is it so warm at night?

> The Meteorological Service of Singapore (MSS) had already predicted two days prior to July 18 that warm conditions are to be expected in the first few days of the second half of July 2022.

> This is due to stable atmospheric conditions arising from the presence of dry air over Singapore and the surrounding region.

> MSS predicted on July 15: ""On a few nights, it can be relatively warm and humid when southeast winds blow moist air from the sea toward land.""

> ""Night-time minimum temperatures of up to 28°C can be expected, particularly over the eastern and southern coastal areas of the island.""

> First two weeks of July 2022 was already hot

> The 29.4°C temperature comes on the back of two weeks of relatively high day time temperatures.

> MSS said the highest daily maximum temperature in the first half of July 2022 was 34.8°C recorded on July 4 at Marina Barrage.

> On several nights in the past two weeks, the daily minimum temperatures recorded over many parts of Singapore were above 27°C.

> Some respite from heat over next two weeks

> The second half of July 2022 will bring some respite.

> For the last two weeks of the month, the monsoon rain band is forecast to lie close to the equator to bring more rainfall over the equatorial Southeast Asia region.

> Short-duration showers, at times with thunder, are expected over a few parts of the island in the late morning and afternoon

> Some of the thundery showers could be heavy, and are expected to take place in the predawn hours and morning on some days.

> After clocking 4min 27.26sec at the Flanders Cup in Belgium on Saturday (July 16) to rewrite Kandasamy Jayamani's previous record of 4:31.2 that was set in 1982, Goh was already eager to build on her feat.

> The break turned out to be crucial for Goh, who clocked a personal best in her first race back, an 800m event in Austria.

> ""I've had a good switch in mindset where I'm committing and being very intentional about every step of the race.""

> During the race, it means pushing through periods of discomfort and tough moments.

> While Goh, who now holds national records in five events, has enjoyed some success recently, it has taken her some time to get to this stage of her career.

> In 2019, they started health podcast Third Spacing, which takes its name from the medical term for the movement of fluid between cells and vessels.

> The series has since racked up nearly 50 episodes covering such topics, and features doctors who have taken unconventional career paths such as going from running a private practice in Singapore to working in Afghanistan.

> Dr Ching, 25, wants to improve marginalised populations' access to healthcare.

> ""As doctors, our work is focused on the body, and some of these topics will inevitably be messy. We have to be very cognisant of where our audience comes from, what their background is, and we work from there (to approach these issues),"" she added.

> She is one of more than 280 undergraduates from the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine who received their bachelor's degrees on Sunday (July 17).

> Some 500 students from the school were also conferred graduate degrees that day, bringing NUS' 28 commencement ceremonies this year to a close. They include medical practitioners, biomedical scientists and healthcare administrators.

> Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, an alumnus, said doctors should continually thirst for knowledge, explore new frontiers and stay true to the profession's values.

> ""Covid-19 was the crisis of your generation, but it will not be the last pandemic. Disease X will demand young people like you to be daring, imaginative and to pioneer breakthroughs in your respective fields,"" said Dr Tan, who was guest of honour at the postgraduate ceremony.

> New healthcare innovations and technologies were developed at an unprecedented pace during the pandemic, he said, adding that researchers around the globe raced against time to work on Covid-19 vaccines and artificial intelligence was harnessed to develop predictive technologies that saved numerous lives.

> Dr Tan reminded doctors about the importance of having strong principles.

> ""It may be tempting to fall back into the chase of the usual brass rings that society typically exhorts us to covet - fancy titles, bigger corner offices, more material possessions. This road may work for some, but it will come at huge costs and sacrifice, and it may also distract you from what is most important.

> ""Once you strip away the technological developments, healthcare is fundamentally a mortal enterprise. When you have a patient entrust their life to you, or when you see the labour of your work benefit countless others, then you will realise when medicine really becomes a fulfilling calling,"" he added.

> The trio had won another bronze in the women's air pistol team event on Tuesday after beating Japan's Yukari Konishi, Mika Zaitsu and Satoko Yamada 16-10 in the play-offs.

> In the individual event, Xiu Hong and Teo had made it to the last eight as the first and seventh qualifiers respectively out of 28 athletes.

> They were in separate ranking matches, where Xiu Hong recorded 14 hits out of 20 shots to edge Austria's Sylvia Steiner out of the medal match by one hit. Meanwhile, Teo topped her ranking match with 15 hits.In the four-woman medal match, the shooter with the lowest score after four rounds is knocked out, following which there will be further eliminations after two rounds until the champion is determined.

> India's Manu Bhaker was the first to fall after recording just nine hits in the first 20 shots. Xiu Hong led after six rounds with 23 hits but Frenchwoman Mathilde Lamolle and Teo were tied at 19 hits and required a shootout to decide who would progress. They drew 3-3 in the first shootout round, before Lamolle won 4-3.

> However, Xiu Hong was just too accurate and another perfect round meant that she led 28-21 and had an unassailable lead going into the final round.

> Singapore Shooting Association president Michael Vaz hailed the shooters' achievements despite not having a finals range and a similar competitive environment to train in at home.

> Congratulating the team, he also praised the champion, noted her growth and said: ""In 2018, I watched Xiu Hong enter the finals in the World Cup in Changwon, but the fear of shooting in a finals range terrified her. The lack of training in finals events saw her eliminated in the first round.

> ""Much has changed. In January 2022, I watched her struggle during the ISSF Jakarta GP to win a bronze. And Xiu Hong is now a World Cup champion, while Shun Xie also fought her way to a bronze medal, both of which are truly commendable achievements.""

> SINGAPORE - An appeal to donate blood as supplies run low has drawn an overwhelming response, with more than 3,300 people coming forward over the past week.

> This represents a 43 per cent increase from a typical week's collection, said the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), which is the Republic's national blood donor recruiter.

> ""We hope that this momentum will continue next week to bring our blood stocks up to healthy levels,"" said the humanitarian organisation.

> Located at the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) building in Outram Road, the Bloodbank@HSA - one of four blood banks across the island - was packed when The Straits Times visited on Friday (July 15).

> Among the donors there was Mr Goh Chee Wee, who said it was his first time donating since 1996.

> Work and other commitments, which often require him to travel, left little time for him to donate blood in the years since then, said the 43-year-old army regular.

> He was there with about 40 others from his unit, which had made an informal request for servicemen to volunteer to donate blood that day.

> Mr Goh, whose blood type is A+, said he was inspired by recent social media posts put out by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who shared SRC's call for blood donors to come forward.

> He added that as a sergeant major, he felt it was important to lead by example.

> Full-time national serviceman Eldridge Surianto was a first-time blood donor.

> The 19-year-old, who has O+ blood, said his decision to donate blood was a personal one - he has relatives who required blood transfusions because of cancer treatments.

> ""I was quite nervous at first,"" he said, noting that he had heard that giving blood could cause dizziness.

> ""But after this experience, I don't think it's that scary,"" said Mr Surianto, adding that he would consider doing it again in future.

> On July 8, SRC had called for more blood donors, said a spokesman, as there was less than nine days' worth of A+ and O+ blood then.

> SINGAPORE - On a rollercoaster World Games debut, Singapore's top pool player Aloysius Yapp overcame his recent voodoo against the Philippines' Carlo Biado to pick up a historic men's 9-ball pool bronze medal on Saturday (July 16).

> The 26-year-old said: ""It feels good as I wasn't expecting anything coming into this event. I had just switched to a new cue last week, and was working on some stroke fundamentals, so it is definitely nice to get one over Carlo and win a medal here.""

> The World Games are an international multi-sport event comprising sports and disciplines that are not contested at the Olympics. This July 7-17 edition, which features 30 sports and 3,600 athletes from 110 nations and territories, is held in Birmingham, Alabama, United States.

> World No. 7 Yapp first cruised past New Zealand's 169th-ranked Matt Edwards 11-3 in the round of 16 on Thursday before overcoming Spain's world No. 5 Francisco Sanchez-Ruiz 11-7 in Friday's quarter-finals.

> Sanchez-Ruiz is one of the game's most in-form players, having teamed up with David Alcaide to beat Yapp and Toh Lian Han in the World Cup of Pool final in June.

> However, luck was not on Yapp's side in Saturday's semi-final when he lost 11-7 in his first meeting with Bosnia and Herzegovina's 22nd-ranked Sanjin Pehlivanovic, who was later beaten 11-8 by Germany's Joshua Filler in the final.

> He said: ""Sanchez-Ruiz and I played really well in our quarter-final, and I felt I was playing even better in the semi-final. Sanjin and I were tied at 7-7, and he was lucky to win most of those racks he had up to that point with a lot of fluke pots.

> ""After that I played two bad safety shots and had one dry break on the alternate breaks, and lost.""

> Still, with less than an hour to cope with the disappointment, Yapp rebounded in style to beat defending champion Biado 11-8. The Filipino had beaten him in the 2021 US Open final and this year's SEA Games men's 9-ball semi-final.

ighjkpv,w1002v,e3x0u,"# What is this?

MRTracker is a physical map of the MRT that tracks the location of trains in near real-time. It is a PCB with an array of LEDs on them and an ESP32 that gets the real-time location of trains. An LED will be lit for every train currently on the network. Currently the North-South and East-West lines are supported.

In the background, there is a web service that polls SMRT’s train API and transforms the arrival times of all lines at all stations into a map of individual trains on the network. (So, the accuracy of train locations is determined by the accuracy of these arrival timings.) The MRTracker board retrieves the map from this service periodically.

If you’ve seen [traintrackr.io](https://www.traintrackr.io/) then this is something like that, but adapted for Singapore.

[Here is Geoff Marshall explaining traintrackr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=676xnII2OZg)

# Why make this?

I secretly think trains and their networks are really cool. I wouldn’t want to get on the first trip of a new model of train, think of it as less 15-year-old train enthusiast and more Reece Martin.

I also think there’s something attractive in exploring data in new ways. We have train arrival data, but how can we transform it into something else? How about real-time locations of trains? It might not be useful to a commuter who just wants to know when their train is coming, but it could be useful to see how many trains are on the network, how backed up it is, or how quickly the trains are moving.

Also I just really love developing hardware. It’s a more constrained but also more intimate form of development compared to modern web development “in the large”. Good luck holding the entirety of your 100k-SLOC monolith in your head.

# Some limitations

* The locations are as accurate as SMRT's train data. From observation, this source data lags actual trains by a minute or so.
* WiFi only, no 3G/4G data connectivity. You'll always need to be in range of your WiFi network.
* The board is exactly as you see it. It doesn't come with a cool case, or even a battery. In some ways this is good as it gives the product a kind of rough aesthetic and cuts down the per-unit cost.
* Only NS/EW lines are supported for now. It's possible to add the other SMRT lines but SBS lines are harder as I'm not aware of any public SBS API for that.

# Where to from here?

Honestly this was just a fun side project. If enough people are actually interested in having their own MRTracker I might start a kickstarter for this and improve the product (appearance, data reliability, cost etc).",2022-07-17 13:44:58+08:00,164,1658038839.0

Besides dominating the net, ASG also nullified LKY's attack by playing lots of drives and deceptive shots. On the rare occasions that he had to lift, he tried to make it deceptive by holding it until the very last minute. It was painful watching a fast player like LKY with supposedly light and quick footwork being made to scramble back and forth. 

In attack, ASG's smashes were very powerful and accurate even when he was not in the best initial position due to his ability to back-pedal very quickly. He also attacked LKY's backhand with lots of shot variation especially in the 2nd game. I think LKY's weak backhand ultimately cost him the game and the match.

I think this game exposed a lot of LKY's weaknesses namely his backhand, anticipation skills and ability to play patiently. I was disappointed, really, as I was expecting at least a tight match.

> The two players were neck to neck in the second game as Ginting led 11-10 at the break. The Indonesian went on to build an unassailable lead to take the final victory.

> This is Ginting's first career win over the Singaporean, who beat him on two previous occasions.

> Ginting will face Japan's Kodai Naraoka in the finals, which will happen on Sunday at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

> Earlier in the day, Naraoka defeated China's Zhao Jun Peng in the semi-finals, taking 21-18, 25-23 in 50 minutes.

> Both individuals had recently travelled to India and had immediately self-isolated after testing positive for Covid-19, said the Ministry of Health on Saturday in response to queries by The Straits Times.

> They have since fully recovered.

> The emerging Omicron sub-variant was first detected in India in early May.

> The BA.2.75 variant, nicknamed ""Centaurus"", has been detected in other countries like the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada.

> Scientists have reportedly said the BA.2.75 variant may be able to spread rapidly and get around immunity from vaccines and previous infection.

> The BBC reported on Friday that it was not yet clear whether this sub-variant was one to worry about or not.

> MOH said there is currently no evidence to indicate the sub-variant has substantially different virulence or severity compared with its Omicron predecessors.

> The ministry noted that as at Thursday, the World Health Organisation has classified BA.2.75 as an Omicron sub-variant under monitoring.

> The Guardian reported that WHO's chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said there were not yet enough samples to assess its severity.

> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the BA.2.75 variant as a variant under monitoring on July 7.

> This means there are indications it could be more transmissible or associated with more severe disease, but the evidence is weak or has not yet been assessed.

> In Singapore, as at Saturday noon, there were 9,153 new Covid-19 cases recorded, according to MOH's daily update.

> The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.03.

Corroborated reports from Redditors:

The presentation is solely by the school counsellor, no external org involved. The presentation was not vetted by the school. 

HCI's principal will be addressing the school regarding this presentation on Monday morning. [Email here](https://i.imgur.com/yYXTrrL.png)

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BQcUBSmw_o) from truelove.is was shown at the end

The slides were shown as an example that sexual orientation is a ""polarising"" issue, of something that is presented as a negative.

Some quotes from the speaker:

- ""SSA (same sex attraction) is not a sign of being gay/homosexual""

- ""We should not be too hasty in labelling ourselves""

- (Paraphrased for intention) If you've came out as LGBT, it's not the end of the world. Implying that it is a big ""decision"".

Yet we are still mired in this ridiculous 3rd-world secular and conservative mindset.

We love to shit on people, because it makes us feel better about ourselves. We love religion, because it provides us an opportunity to judge from a moral high-ground. We claim to have institutionalised racial harmony and inclusiveness, yet I have been privy to and witnessed snide remarks made towards my compatriots of different races.

I'm not very interested in activism. There are many things I dislike about the world and my day-to-day life. I usually keep my head down and try to make a difference in my own life and the lives of people around me. But shit like this gives just a glimpse into a wider, underlying systemic problem.

Groupthink, lack of emotional maturity, emotionally closeted, fear of confrontation (and addressing contentious issues), social loafing (ah let the other people who care more deal with it), backstabbing/badmouthing, selfishness, the obsession with results instead of actual growth (show-and-tell, wayang etc.).

There’s a hell lot of misinfo swirling around after the arrival of (now former) Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the most damning of which is the allegation that the Singapore government deliberately and willingly laid out the red carpet for a mass-murdering Sri Lankan despot because of some sense of authoritarian kinship between the two entities. This insane narrative has taken on a life of its own on FB and Twitter among both our right-wing populists and left-wing crusaders.

I said a few days ago in a separate thread that Singapore has a politically impoverished culture and that the establishment is only partially to blame for this state of affairs. Well here we have the Chief Clown of the opposition political party People’s Voice alleging in a long string of unhinged rants on his page (this is one) that we gave Rajapaksa special treatment because the corrupt SG government opens its legs and wallet wide for war criminals. The populist makes himself sound credible by sprinkling half-truths into an ultimately nonsensical narrative made up entirely of tantalising falsehoods. As per usual there’s racists in the comments saying crazy racist shit about Singaporean Indians that isn’t even related to the subject matter, but that’s par for the course.

Rajapaksa made use of the Jetquay CIP/VIP terminal at Changi Airport. Fact, but also a fact: Anyone can if they have the money. The terminal is effectively for hire for high net worth individuals, celebs, dignitaries and atas people in that general bracket. It isn’t always the SG government that picks up the bill for big shots that choose to use the discreet terminal for enhanced privacy.

Rajapaksa was given a vehicular escort. Fact, but also a fact: This is SOP for all visiting dignitaries. He was not singled out for VIP treatment and certainly did not have the red carpet laid out for him. He isn’t having kopi and kueh with Halimah at the Istana nor is he on a state visit. We did the same thing for NK’s Kim Jong-un and he’s arguably an even bigger tyrant. Rajapaksa was still President when he landed and following SOP does not equate to apathy or even endorsement of his crimes unlike what some would have us think.

VIPC is owned by MFA. Only ministers and above can use and they have to be cleared to use by MFA. Not any Tom Dick Harry can use, all must be cleared to enter or exit. And typically is used when got official visits or state level VIP come SG. 

In this case, not sure he was accorded VIPC, but he was still president when he touched down, so MFA might decide to accord him as such. If not, he probably paid his way in via Jet Quay.

Unfortunately, a balance has to be struck between what customers see as a ""reasonable"" price in order to attract orders away from your competitors, while also being enough to pay all your employees a ""reasonable"" wage.

Edit: the video was for the Malaysian side. The Singapore side should hopefully be better about it, due to the relatively smaller volume they'd have to handle.",2022-07-16 16:45:22+08:00,10,1657961457.0

igdocj0,w080su,72799sjj,"From my experience, it heavily depend on the courier assigned to your area. Last year, I lost 2 parcels worth $200. I ordered during a sale and the parcels came 1 week apart. Both times, SXXXXE Express claimed that the parcels were delivered to my door and it got lost afterwards. My place is heavily secured with many cameras. I was also working at home and knew no-one came to my door. I asked for proved that the delivery did happen. I wish to verified with CCTV and will make police report on the ""Theft"". Many back and for. Long story short, SXXXXe refunded me my money, made the seller pay for the lost. The seller thought I was those scam buyer, because Sxxxxe told them they actually delivered. I almost got blacklisted by the seller. No reasons were given for Sxxxxe's claim that it was stolen. 5 weeks later, a courier came to my door with my ""stolen"" parcels. Turns out, the courier assigned to my area has be clicking the delivered button without even showing up to the area. They did an investigation and found the undelivered parcels.

igd6ckr,w06u9z,lhzhg,"I walked past the queue, it's only the initial opening queue that was 4 hours, in the evening you could get it within 20 minutes.

There were a few Japanese-speaking people in queue, so I imagine about 30% are people who miss the taste of donuts popular in their country.

For those saying KK and DD are better, it's subjective. KK and DD are both way too sweet compared to MD (for me), they're also less chewy compared to MD.

MD's chocolate varieties machiam like brownies though, so maybe some people prefer that, ultimately it's mostly just subjective, plus the store's only here for 1 month so a slight bit of fomo probably.

After the first weekend I don't think it's gonna sustain a queue beyond 5 minutes tbh",2022-07-16 14:42:15+08:00,50,False

igdggnc,w06tp1,gb4icbu6,"The comments here are absolutely disgusting. I'd never understood the saying ""sinkie pwn sinkie"" until recently, the comments here truly reflect this. 

A lot of people that do food delivery are from the low SES population - many of whom don't have many choices when it comes to jobs. Money is the strongest incentive for these workers, and the way the delivery platforms have structured their incentives have made it so they have to complete a certain amount of orders in a limited timespan. Most of the money comes from incentives. 

There's a large company pulling the strings here, knowing people are going to be working harder for incentives when you offer them, and you want to blame the workers? Get off your high horses man, these are your own brothers and sisters suffering. So many of you get a hard-on talking about how you're true-blue Singaporeans because you serve NS but you can't show a little compassion for disadvantaged Singaporeans.",2022-07-16 16:51:17+08:00,97,False

igfcnrt,w06tp1,1nc0gdkk,"I think that SEA and SG is where Big Tech meets cheap, expendable, 3rd World labor... in the US (and probably Europe?), delivery workers drive vehicles, if not SUVs (in my experience, their cars are always better than my wreck) so you don't get people risking their lives on the road for some incentive. Plus companies can face huge liability suits, if not from the individual, the state or some other group can file. The story in the article is really terrible, I mean there should be some liability on Grab's part - yes, it's true that this eventually gets passed onto the consumer but it means less exploitation of workers from a supposedly developed country.

To add to my rant: SG is a corporation's wet dream - First World tech and infrastructure + 3rd World labor laws and costs.",2022-07-17 02:47:28+08:00,23,False
igdb952,w06tp1,am0eouxu,"Lol, way to 'victimise' the delivery riders. Not sure If anyone else has encountered, but my area is full of food delivery riders with zero regard for pedestrian or street safety.

I'm sure all aren't like this, but I've seen far too many with zero regard for their surroundings. This is how you get charged and go prison when you hit someone because you weren't aware of the surroundings. Or find yourself in an accident.

Don't use cycling track is one thing, they zoom in and out of pedestrians, have zero lights, ring bell when you don't give way to them. So many times I nearly get in accidents with them. Like bodoh, if you hit someone, not only you hurt them, you hurt yourself, your food spill then how? 

And they are not a minority either. Food delivery riders don't want to be antagonized? Then tell these fuckers to not be an entitled asshole especially on pedestrian pavements.
