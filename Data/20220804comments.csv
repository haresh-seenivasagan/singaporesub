> SINGAPORE - It was meant to be a celebratory meal after the Neustadter Laufermeeting in Germany on Friday (Aug 5) but Singapore runner Goh Chui Ling's dinner was literally as flat as a pizza.

> The base of the seafood pizza for her dinner with friends was not salty enough, the tomato sauce was of low quality and the seafood tasted a bit sour.

> Fortunately for Goh, that was the only low point of an otherwise happy day for her as she broke her fourth national record this year - this time in the 3,000m.

> The 29-year-old clocked 9min 51.16sec in Neustadt an de Waldnaab, a small town in the south-east of Germany, to break K. Jayamani's 40-year-old record of 9:56.6 set in 1982.

> The record is pending ratification by Singapore Athletics.

> It was the first time Goh was racing in the 3,000m - a distance which is no longer on the programme at the Olympics and World Championships - and she was using it as preparation for the Aug 20 2.4km Pocari Sweat Run Singapore.

> She told The Straits Times: ""I knew that it would not come easy, it was not going to be something I could stride through and still get the record.

> ""I knew if I put in the work, I would get it. When I finished and saw my time, I was happy because it was my first-ever 3,000m. Hopefully in time to come, when I get to race more, I can lower it further.""

> This is now the seventh national mark that Goh holds, including two relays.

> Her good form started last October, when she broke the national best in the 10,000m (road) before rewriting her own mark just five weeks later.

> She then broke the 2.4km national best at the Pocari Sweat Run in January and set a new 5,000m (road) mark a month before the May SEA Games.

> She clinched two medals in the 1,500m and 10,000m at the SEA Games in Hanoi, while settling for fourth in the 800m.

> Last month, she rewrote another Jayamani record, the 40-year-old 1,500m national mark. With her latest record, Goh's momentum seems to be continuing its upward trajectory.

> Of her achievements, the lawyer, who is pursuing a PhD in international sports law and governance and is in Zurich as part of an exchange programme, said: ""It means boundaries can be broken. I'm starting to see that - of course there are limitations to training when it's hot and humid - but we can push limits to our bodies.

> ""To me, it's about knowing that I can break boundaries, and so can other Singaporeans in these distances.""

ij61c7f,whjhzy,n9wj4,"Same thing can be asked, why can't school start later? Waking up at 5-6am isn't exactly healthy om the developing mind.

I remember a dad mentioned about what he thinks is the reason why his kids don't want to sleep early- School already takes up like half of their day, which means that if they sleep early, that's more ""lost time"" to the remaimder of the day they have. So they compensate the lost time by sleeping later",2022-08-06 17:38:18+08:00,33,False
ij65e9u,whjhzy,56yhqpnn,"Later start times for schools is the obvious solution, but it’s still logistically tough currently. 

A lot of secondary schools already have some “late start” days every week, but on those days you can still see many students in school at the “normal” time because that’s the time their parents can afford to send them to school. With the emergence of post-covid flexible work arrangements this can be better mitigated. 

But starting late also means ending late. There are a certain number of academic periods required by MOE and these are pretty set in stone for most schools. The one extra hour in the morning has to be made up elsewhere. We can 1) cut syllabus to reduce teaching periods required, or 2) cut number of required subjects, or 3) cut other non-academic activities. 3 seems most likely currently and is probably also the one that will get the most public support.",2022-08-06 18:35:21+08:00,10,False
ij5vi1g,whi5l9,oho16v0p,"My philosophy is that the employee/employer relationship is a purely transactional one. There is no such thing as loyalty. You pay me market rate, set out the scope and prescribed hours, and I work for you to the best of my abilities. I won't mind the odd overtime, just don't cross the line too often. 

This mindset applies to job interviews as well - which are meetings for *both* parties to suss out and ""interrogate"" each other. You'll never be intimidated by interviews by viewing the relationship this way.",2022-08-06 16:15:05+08:00,25,False

I don't believe it's entitled to not want to be exploited. Me providing additional labor only increases the money in the CEO's pocket,  there is no incentive for me. Either stick to contractual hours or pay us if we are forced to work extra.",2022-08-06 17:44:00+08:00,15,1659780637.0
