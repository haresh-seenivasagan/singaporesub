Question about riding the Circle Line,"As I am a daily North South Line rider , I am not so familiar about the Circle Line. However , I now need to take the Circle Line on some days and I am not sure how it goes. Let's say I want to take the train from Serangoon to Marina Bay , based on my previous ride , it would go to Doby Ghaut instead of Marina Bay. Is there a direct train that does not curve into Doby Ghaut? How do I get from Don't Ghaut to Marina Bay without changing lines?

"Oi, You Xiao Ah?","*Stigmatism of mental health in past & modern-day Singapore*

Growing up, I always thought people who had ""mental problems"", like the neurotic psychopaths you see on TV or in the news, mostly supervillains (e.g the Joker) or that one flasher in your neighborhood, are like what the general population thinks, ""violent, unstable and unreliable"" It was a totally black-and-white view of mental health, but it was the norm.

In school, ""autistic"" was an insult and depression was something to be made fun of. It was seen as an edgy or attention-seeking thing to claim. However, when I was in Secondary 3, I started to feel symptoms of depression and anxiety. My social and academic performance deteriorated but I didn't speak up, because I thought I would be deemed ""weak"" and ""abnormal"", as my parents fed into the societal stigma themselves. Luckily, I managed to gather my courage to tell an adult about it this year and I quickly got a diagnosis of General Anxiety Disorder, depression and ADHD, the former having sprung over not being diagnosed with ADHD earlier. I am in therapy now and am relatively happier. I started reasearching about mental health too, and found it was more common than I thought.

 Apparently, according to a 2018 health survey by IMH, approximately 14% of Singaporeans have experienced some form of mental health condition in their lifetime. Despite this, most of them do not seek any form of help for their mental health conditions and those who tend to do so after a significant delay after the occurrence of their condition (yours truly). 
Why, you may ask? **MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA** 

Mental health stigma causes disorders like mine to be seen as negative, socially discrediting behaviour, so much so that it becomes an undesirable and rejected stereotyped rather than an accepted and normal one, moreover, it is the root cause behind poor support and care towards their disorders. In Singapore's context, it can be largely attributed towards our traditional beliefs and cultures, where pride is prioritised and anomalies such as mental health is seen as a sign of shame and weakness (cannot ""save face"" in front of your peers). Our cultures are traditional patriarchal, which is why men are discouraged from showing physical and mental weakness, due to the toxic masculinity stereotypes. 

The question of the purpose reducing the stigma of mental health could be answered by its dire implications. In a 2018 study conducted by IMH, 78.4% of individuals with mental health conditions never seek any form of professional treatment. Those that do delay it on an average of 11 years for OCD, 2 years for anxiety, and a year for depression which is more than enough time for it to consume you. To make things worse, Singapore has **extremely poor mental health support**. It has one of the lowest rates of psychiatrists among first-world nations, with approximately 2.8 psychatrists for every 100,000 residents, compared to Australia, which has 13.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 residents. This general lack of financial and societal awareness on both the government and people will lead to lasting negative impacts on the general public perception of mental health, which only makes the battle against its stigma more difficult. 

Now you may say: but with the advent of the Internet, the younger generation is more open-minded. Well, that is not totally right. Although there is more campaigns on mental health awareness now, a 2017 study on mental health stigma in SG youths found approximately 44.5% of teens associated mental illnesses with derogatory terms like ""stupid, dangerous, crazy and weird"" while 46.2% said they would be ""very embarrassed"" if they were diagnosed with a mental illness. In contrast, only 25.5% of them associated mental illnesses with empathetic terms like ""pitiful"", ""sad"", ""needs love/care"". 

Overall, I personally feel unless there is greater awareness on mental health, as well as a proactive push against its trivialisation rather than some campaigns and charities for good PR but thrown aside the minute it's not popular, it's impacts on our society and health can be more serious in the future. One proposal I have is for the government to subsidize mental health care, as personally the psychiatry and therapy costs are too expensive for those who are underprivileged to afford. On a positive note, schools do focus on a lot of mental health awareness projects for us students.",w206jz,8,0.56,Opinion / Fluff Post,2022-07-18 22:04:40+08:00,14,55po5527,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w206jz/oi_you_xiao_ah/,,False,False

Fact Checking the Shitty Slides from the HC talk,"Edit: Added headings because reading this hurt my eyes.

Edit (2): Adding some helpful additions from other posters. I haven't had the time to personally fact check all of the other additions, so I am just attributing the poster and including their sources.

In part due to boredom, but also in hopes of showing our LGBT members that they probably do not have intestinal worms, I decided to fact check all the claims made in the HC talk. Special thanks to u/shimmynywimminy for providing better resolutions of the slides. I also copy (with thanks) some other posters acknowledged below.

# Summary

\- The slides are largely inaccurate. Either because the sources cited are not reliable, are very old, are not academic sources, or an unholy mixture of all of the above.

\- There are however some points which are not wholly inaccurate. That said even here, other relevant factors tend to be ignored. E.g. saying LGBT are more prone to alcohol abuse, without saying that they are more driven to substance abuse due to the discrimination they face. I mean after looking at the slides in detail, I think I can say that the HC counsellor's talk really made *me* want to have some alcohol. 

\- Some issue are however reflective of areas of concern for the LGBT. Of course this doesn't meant that being LGBT is bad because they have these issues - in the same way that because certain ethnic groups have specific issues they deal with.

# 1) 58% of Homosexuals have intestinal worms

The given source is ""*Fields, Dr. E. ""Is Homosexual Activity Normal*"" *Marietta, GA*. Google brings up this document - [https://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/djetc/homo\_not\_normal.pdf](https://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/djetc/homo_not_normal.pdf), which looks a lot more like a propaganda pamphlet rather than an academic study. The claim that homosexuals have intestinal worms is just asserted without any evidence on the study done to obtain such numbers (""*Depending on the city some 39% to 59% have been infected with intestinal parasites such as worms*"".

As an added bonus  ""Fields, Dr. E."" is not a medical doctor. He is a chiropractor. He is also a white supremacist - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward\_Reed\_Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Reed_Fields)

I did however find academic [research from 1980](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1704818/?fbclid=IwAR374CjW2MZNa7H_NI4oGd56glbGQwdtcHRhB7F6fi2z0LIUiS5uG1IQzmk) showing that homosexual men have an infection rate of 67.5% compared to 16% for straight men. Given how old this research is, I don't think you can rely too much on this. Some posters have also pointed out that the research method of this paper is flawed due to sampling bias.

However even this paper says ""A*mong the homosexual men recent foreign travel, living in a homosexual household and promiscuity were not correlated with intestinal parasitic infection, but* ***cleansing of the anus before and sex was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of infection***"".

In other words having intestinal worms has nothing much to do with being gay or sleeping around. Rather it has everything to do with washing your bum. PSA - wash you bum.

# 2) 1 in 15 Homosexuals is a pedophile

This comes from ""Psychological reports 1986 58 pp. 327-37"" ([https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.327](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.327)). What the relevant part of the abstract actually says is this -  ""*Considering only children's claims of sex with men, about a third were homosexual molestations*"".

I will admit that I didn't read the full paper and only saw the abstract, but the problems are immediate - this is a study about victims of child molestation. How do you derive demographic trends on all homosexuals being pedophiles? The study is also old (1986). Just to highlight some great comments from u/TaliyahTt \- [you can molest a child of your same gender without being homosexual](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w0h1z2/comment/igetr51/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

# 3) 33% of homosexuals struggle with alcoholism

The source comes from ""*Kaifetz. J. ""Homosexual Rights are a Concern for Some*"" *Post-Tribune, 18 December 1992.* Well the first and most obvious point is that ""Post-Tribune"" sounds very much like a newspaper rather than an academic publication. Unfortunately I cannot find a copy of the article online. This guy does seem to be citied very frequently by anti-LGBT articles so it's a bit surprising that the actual article is so hard to come by.

Unfortunately, I do want to point out that there is a generally observed trend that LGBT communities may abuse alcohol more than straight communities (see e.g. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/gay-men-hiv-homophobia-lgbt-drink-drugs](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/gay-men-hiv-homophobia-lgbt-drink-drugs)). Of course one of the major reasons is that LGBT people are pushed to alcohol as a way of coping with all the anti-LGBT stuff they have to put up with. So please reach out to any LGBT persons you might know that are dealing with these issues.

# 4) On average a gay man has up to 80 sexual partners a year

The source for this is ""Sexual transmission of Hepatitis A in homosexual men : incidence and mechanism"" ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6243391/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6243391/)). This was a study on Hep A transmission and not sexual partner habits among homosexual men. While the full text is not available, the abstract says "" We performed monthly examinations and serologic tests for antibody to hepatitis virus A (anti-HA) in a study of 57 heterosexual men and 102 homosexual men followed prospectively for a mean of 8.9 months and 6.1 months, respectively...  Diaries concerning sexual behavior kept by homosexual men showed that the acquisition of hepatitis A virus infection contact."".

I'm going to guess that somewhere in this study, the 102 homosexual men indicate in their dairies that they had sex with 80 sexual partners in that year, and that figure is being used in the HC slides. Of course would be a bogus conclusion since these findings are incidental to the main research being conducted (Hep A transmission).

The study is also really old - 1980. A more recent study ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334840/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334840/)) that is directly on point suggests that gay men are more likely to have around 3-4 in a year (depending on age) and 15-67 in a life time (also depending on age). So, not 1000 in a life time, but 67.

# 5) Perfect Correlation between Childhood Rape and Homosexual Behavior. 47% of gays admit to having been raped by an adult man during their childhood

Maybe because I'm not a counsellor, but just on the wording of this I have absolutely no idea what is being said. If there is a ""perfect"" correlation then we should expected either (a) all childhood rape victims are homosexual; or (b) all homosexuals were raped as children. Both seem absolutely unlikely.

Anyway the source is [https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/2001-tomeo.pdf](https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/2001-tomeo.pdf). The study asked respondents whether they have been molested as children. The results are - straight men and women (24.4% and 24.6%) versus gay men and lesbian women (49% and 52%, or specifically molestation by same gender 45% and 29%). What's interesting is that the study *directly states that* ""**Most men who molest boys and most men who molest girls are heterosexual in their adult sexual preference** (Groth and Birnbaum, 1978) "" and "" **It must also be borne in mind that the present homosexual participants may not be representative of homosexual persons.** ""

So the best I can say about this is (a) LGBT people being molested as children is a terrible thing; (b) however this does not mean that LGBT are more likely to molest children; (c) in fact if you are molested as a child and the molester is a man, then that man is likely to be straight; and (d) this study is not reflective of LGBT people generally.

# 6) Homosexuals are 2% of population but 33% of Pedophile Rapists

The source is [https://archive.ph/sX8zg](https://archive.ph/sX8zg). The 33% figure apparently comes from the *Jounal of Sex & Married Therapy* (""1/3 of male sex offenders directed their sexual activity against males"") and ""*Journal of Sex Research* (""homosexual pedophiles commit about 1/3 of total sex offences against children\*).\* Unfortunately there are zero detailed citations to these sources.

In general this statistic seems to not account for the fact that heterosexual men can commit sex offences against boys (see 2) above.

I'm sure it will shock no one that the writer of the source is neither a doctor or an academic. He's a conservative radio host from the American Family Association which (**surprise!**) has been designated as a hate group. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan\_Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fischer). This guy also thinks that the holocaust was caused by homosexuals in Nazi Germany.

# 7) 78% of Homosexuals have STDs

At this point I'm starting to wonder why I tried to unravel all these lies and getting a headache. So I hope you don't mind I duck out and just cite u/nutting_ham who dealt with this in his post:

>Thanks to [u/shimmynywimminy](https://www.reddit.com/u/shimmynywimminy/) I found the actual source. **It's worse.** It's a [book written by Enrique Rueda](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815957157/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) published in **1982/1986**, who doesn't appear to be an academic. That's right folks it's **not even a study**, it's in fact actually a **680** pages book from a raging homophobe, which according to [this amazon review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22XXXZSQADU0F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815957157), had a lot of things to say. For the sake of brevity, the writer suggests that, homosexuals are sinful, that his CATHOLIC CHURCH would be under fire for him speaking the truth. The cherry on the frothing cake -- he suggests that the gay agenda is out to establish a female controlled homosexual society where MALES would be fuckin' LIQUIDATED by abortion and the few remaining males would be used as spermatozoa sources for future implantation. (No really **I swear I'm not making this shit up.** Also funny how it sounds like the Great Replacement Theory doesn't it?!)  
>  
>Anyway because it's not a study, **I was not able to access the testing methodology** behind this 78% statistic from a catholic guy who has some talent for writing some crazy dystopian shit, and clearly, not an academic in any way.

# 8) 23% of children with lesbian parents have been sexually abused

The source is [https://archive.ph/5UPbM](https://archive.ph/5UPbM). This a lifesitenews article citing a study by Mark Regnerus who is described as a sociology professor at the university of Texas. I'm not a sociology professor, so I'll just note that this study has attracted so much controversy that it has an entire wikipedia page detailing why other academics have criticized the findings of Regnerus - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Family\_Structures\_Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Family_Structures_Study).

For what it's worth here's what wiki also adds -  *Major academic organizations including the* [*American Sociological Association*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sociological_Association)*,* [*American Academy of Pediatrics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics) *and* [*American Medical Association*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association) *dispute the validity of Regnerus's data and conclusions reached thereof, arguing that unlike previous studies, the statistically tiny number of same sex couples in a study whose sample group largely consisted of failed heterosexual marriages where one of the parents was allegedly homosexual, make it impossible to extrapolate any information about same sex parenting*. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Regnerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Regnerus)

For this one my personal take is that I don't have the time or energy to dive into such a contested academic area, so if any dear reader wants to take up this issue, please go ahead.

# 9) Homosexuals represent 2% of pop but 67% of AIDS Patients

The source is [https://archive.ph/scA5b](https://archive.ph/scA5b) \- the data appears to be from the CDC, which reported that ""*however in 2013, MSM accounted for 67% of all new HIV diagnoses*"". The primary source from the CDC does appear to check out, and also maps current trends recorded by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/cdc-msm-508.pdf), as well as in [Singapore](https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/infectious-disease-statistics/hiv-stats/update-on-the-hiv-aids-situation-in-singapore-2021-(june-2022)#:~:text=The%20annual%20number%20of%20new,aged%2020%20to%2049%20years).

There's nothing much to say there other than maybe the slide is inaccurate to lump all LGBT under ""homosexuals"" when this is clearly a gay man issue.

Still **wear your condoms, and practice safe sex.**

u/fioccinauci adds:

>For 9), I additionally would like to point out that AIDS is not a moral failing (it’s a medical condition!) and I reckon that why society at large stigmatises it is, cyclically, largely due to its association with gay men (cf. how it was reported in the “HIV epidemic” of the 80s in the US).  
>  
>Also want to point out that there are many data points for HIV/AIDS that one could cherrypick — including that, globally, [women have been found to be disproportionally affected by HIV both due to biological and sociological factors](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/S0020-7292%2803%2900202-9)!! It’s quite maddening that whoever did this series of “facts” about the LGBT community cherrypicked the data specifically in a way that further demonises the community. Not only is this intellectually dishonest, it further perpetuates stigma of an already marginalised group of people AND of a condition that has afflicted millions — regardless of gender or sexual orientation — over the decades :(

# 10) 51% of domestic violence occur in same sex couples

The source is from Newsweek 4 October 1993. Unfortunately I cannot find the main article. That said I found a BBC article covering the issue in 2014 - [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29994648](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29994648), that I can just briefly quote to address this point:

>But the conclusions of another study this year by the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago - a review of data from four earlier studies, involving 30,000 participants - go further.  
>  
>""One of our startling findings was that rates of domestic violence among same-sex couples is pretty consistently higher than for opposite sex couples,"" says Richard Carroll, a psychologist and co-author of the report.  
>  
>Intrigued by their findings, Carroll's team started to look into the reasons why this might be.  
>  
>**""We found evidence that supports the minority stress model - the idea that being part of a minority creates additional stress,"" he says.**  
>  
>""There are external stressors, like discrimination and violence against gays, and there are internal stressors, such as internalised negative attitudes about homosexuality.""  
>  
>The external stresses on a same-sex relationship include what Carroll describes as the ""double closet phenomenon"" when victims are reluctant to report abuse because they do not want to be outed to the authorities.  
>  
>But it is the internal stress, says Carroll, which can be particularly damaging.  
>  
>""Sometimes homosexual individuals project their negative beliefs and feelings about themselves on to their partner,"" he says.  
>  
>""Conversely, we believe that victims of domestic violence in same-sex couples believe, at some level, they deserve the violence because of internalised negative beliefs about themselves.""",w1ycym,761,0.92,Discussion,2022-07-18 20:40:01+08:00,103,1r7izrhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w1ycym/fact_checking_the_shitty_slides_from_the_hc_talk/,,False,False

How often do couriers lose parcels?,"So the weekend before Hari Raya Haji I ordered a pack of Apple Pencil sleeves from Shopee. The seller was pretty quick in preparing the parcel and shipped it out the following working day. I wasn’t going to be at home when the parcel was going to be delivered the next working day, so I rescheduled the delivery to be on my off day. I had another order that was using the same carrier that was going to be delivered that same day, so I rescheduled it to my off day. On my off day, I received the second parcel, but not the first. 

I called the customer service team and asked them what’s going on, and they said that the parcel has to be located in the warehouse because they have many, many parcels. I was a bit confused — didn’t you get the second parcel out of that many parcels? The two parcels were in the warehouse together for a day, so where’s the first one??

I kind of get why there might be a delay, partly attributed to the recent spike in covid cases and some minor sales campaigns after 7.7, but I’m just thinking, what are my chances of getting my parcel? It’s been stuck in the warehouse for a few days now.

Edit: sorry, the courier is J&T Express",w080su,17,0.7,Discussion,2022-07-16 12:28:05+08:00,27,gie7rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w080su/how_often_do_couriers_lose_parcels/,,False,False
