32,Getting diagnosed for Adult ADHD - IMH/NUH/Private/Anywhere else?,"I've suspected that I have inattentive type ADHD for a long time, and I've finally decided to get an official diagnosis and professional help. I would prefer to go via the subsidised public option given the long term cost of medication, but I'm not opposed to private if there are no suitable options.

I called IMH earlier today and was informed that IMH no longer has an adult ADHD specialist, and I will be referred to a general psychiatrist within 60-90 days. Given what I've read about IMH online, I don't feel very comfortable with what that implies...

Does anyone have recommendations for where else I can get subsidised treatment? For instance, I read that NUH has a psychology department that sees adult ADHD patients. I would be really grateful if anyone can share more about your experience with IMH/NUH or any other clinics, especially about the diagnosis process, cost of medicine and therapy sessions, and overall experience.

44,Any recommendations for psychologist/psychiatrist in the East? (For depression),"Hi everyone, asking for a friend here. 

Friend is going through an ugly divorce and have recently reached out regarding suspicions that she is experiencing signs of depression. 

If I understand it correctly I believe if we lookup the psych registry, they only list names of consultant individual so it is difficult to find out who actually specialises in depression etc.. Personally I don’t know anyone that might be helpful so hoping this subreddit can help. 

Preferences : 

1.	Female consultant
2.	Face-to-face
3.	Anywhere in the East
4.	Preferably consultations that involve machines (that help with depression? i.e. Positive psychology maybe)

She’s open to seeing both psychologist/psychiatrist. No real budget constraints for now. 

I just want her to get regular help asap. Greatly appreciate any recommendations along with any tips on spotting worsening signs of depression!

          I know this is a sensitive topic and works like to ask for practical advice. My sibling is thinking of meeting his Malay muslim girlfriend and he is rather confused ( so am i) about the rules. He does not want to convert to her religion and she does not want to convert to ours (Taoism). I understand in the past that, if one spouse is Muslim the other spouse had to convert to Islam. Is this true? And in this day and age are the marriages between non muslims and Muslims without any conversion? I hope i did not offend anyone.
