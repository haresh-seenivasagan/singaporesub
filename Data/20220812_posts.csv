Last-minute Reservist Deferment?,"Hi all,

I'm a PES-C NS man slated for my first reservist cycle with SCDF **next week** (PSC ICT whatever that means).

Having a bit of a headache because I'm meant to go for a surgery next month and have a one-month pre-op diet where I am only allowed to consume 800 kcal per day through meal replacement shakes.

The doctors have recommended that I don't go for my reservist training as I'll be very weak and have to monitor my blood sugar, etc. I have a **hospital note** with me asking for deferment of my reservice.

The problem is I've only been able to secure the note **this week** due to some complications with my surgery date (it had to get postponed, I was bouncing between clinics trying to get an earlier surgery date). I've been informed today that there isn't enough time to get my deferment processed and will need to contact my NS commander. And due to my presumptiveness, I didn't tell my employer about my reservist cycle because I thought it would be deferred — mistake on my part was underestimating how much long it would take to get a deferment.

Not sure if it's my cynicism from NS (I had very bad commanders) or paranoia, but I have some doubts as to whether I can get my reservist postponed by calling up my unit office and submitting the hospital note.

It seems unlikely to me that I'll be forced to go for training (albeit this is a PES-C program) when  
a government hospital has written a note requesting for me not to go. BUT I have a healthy fear of things not making sense in national service-related bureaucracy.

Guess I'm trying to assuage my concerns by asking if anyone knows what this last-minute process is like?

My worst-case scenario is I'll have to attend the training without much of the proper attire or equipment (the op is to help me lose weight so I didn't buy any new uniforms), screw my workplace team over. Best case scenario is I can defer the training to a few months later.",wmjyj5,0,0.43,Serious Discussion,2022-08-12 20:23:05+08:00,9,85agrvzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/wmjyj5/lastminute_reservist_deferment/,,False,False

Singtel and Gomo,"Horrible experience with them. I attempted to port over from my current starhub plan to gomo and was told that was phone number is a prepaid plan. So I contact support and was basically told that since my phone number was once a prepaid plan (that was 8 years ago), gomo's system is registrating my number as a prepaid phone number and thus, the only way to port over will be to purchase the $30 Singtel SIMOnly, and then change to Gomo. I have never encountered such issue before with other telcos when I was porting and so this seems like just some shady business practice rather than actual technical limitations. 

I need some advise on the best way forward to this, paying the full $30 just to port over temporarily is just ridiculous.

Edit: Many of you seem to be thinking that I'm porting from a prepaid number. I am currently on a starhub Postpaid number. But they said that my number has a history of being a prepaid number (that's 8 years ago before I converted to a postpaid plan) and thus I will have to go through Singtel.

What aspects of Singaporean culture should we make effort to preserve?,"Happy National Day! During a discussion with a friend, he said it is ironic that many young Singaporeans complain that Singapore is dull/boring/lacking culture, but then abandon/reject our diverse traditional cultural practices that make Singapore more vibrant. So let's discuss which aspects of Singaporean culture are declining but we want to preserve!

I want to preserve our community cat culture. In our fast-paced society, the cats are a great source of stress relief, available to anyone for free, because they belong to the community, not one household. They are also cared for by the community (some cats are fed by 2-3 makciks living in the same block) in a throwback to our kampung spirit. However, the community cat population is falling due to successful TNR program, less people feeding them and more accidents/abusers (reflects the bad side of our society), so we need more efforts to preserve our community cat culture.",wkv1jx,40,0.81,Discussion,2022-08-10 19:31:20+08:00,58,hnenpaga,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/wkv1jx/what_aspects_of_singaporean_culture_should_we/,,False,False

Lots of posts here talk about 377a (rightfully so), but I'm also interested in knowing:

* to what extent dating/hookup apps are used (in the LGBTI+ sense not generally)
* are minor public displays of affection (briefly holding hands or kissing) frowned upon?

Advice on the process of getting an apartment in Singapore,"Heya,

Moving to Singapore in early September for work (EP). Absolutely excited!

I have a few questions for you seasoned apartment hunters.

First some context: I've found a few good studios and have had conversations with the realtors/agents (primarily through propertyguru and 99.co). Many of them are telling me that these places are really popular and will probably be off the market in a few days thereby forcing me to make a quick decision. 

What I'm afraid of is that the pictures and videos they've shared with me are not truly representative of what the apartment looks like. While I would love to take a look at them in person, I won't be in Singapore until September by which point, I assume, the apartments would've already been rented out. But the last thing I want to do is sign a 1-year lease on a studio apartment I'll hate.

Questions:

1. How often do Singaporean realtors / agents mislead with pictures and videos? Have you heard many stories of foreigners being burned by signing the lease on an apartment they haven't personally seen?

2. If I was to come to Singapore and look for an apartment while staying at a hotel, how long do you think I'll need to bunk at the hotel? I'm debating between a co-living space for 3 months vs a hotel for a month or 2. I know this is expensive but it's cheaper than the mental cost of disliking the place you're living in for a year.

Happy National Day Singapore," Singapore becomes independent in 1965, when it is actually expelled from Malaysia, I guess the only country in the world that become independent forcibly.  It was earlier part of the Malay federation along with Borneo and Sarawak.

 However the Singapore state Govt differed with the Malaysian Govt, especially on the special privileges given to Malays.  Lee Kuan Yew then Singapore CM, led the demand advocating equal treatment for all races in Malaysia.  Add to it the increasing racial tensions between the Chinese and Malays, especially the 1964 riots, on June 21, that saw many Chinese attacked, and their shops, properties looted. There were economic tensions too. 

 Also there was a fear that Singapore then being the economically dominant province, it would dominate Kuala Lumpur. Singapore had restrictions on trade, with rest of Malayisa, and in turn it refused loans to Sabah and Sarawak. 

 With the UMNO rhetoric rising, and calls to arrest Lee Kuan Yew, then Malaysian PM, thought it would be better to expel Singapore from the Federation, which is how it became an independent nation by force, but proved better in the long run.

i whine about you a lot -
you are so flawed, yet amongst all these flaws, i am able to find a semblance of security and stability i still haven’t been able to find elsewhere.

a land full of opportunities during my grandparent’s time; a land full of unknowns, where they gambled everything and chose to settle here. thank you for being the foundation of my security, especially in my earlier years.

some of my saddest memories have unfolded on your soil - i have felt my worst heartbreaks, disappointments and shed more tears here than anywhere else; and yet these tears, ironically, have helped me to grows roots and be cemented here. now, you hold some of my fondest and most precious memories, too.

in this ephemeral lifetime, i have gone to the himalayas and back, called a few other places home along the way, but you’re the only place that will always have a special place my heart. right here.

Overcharged in restaurant,"
I went for dinner at a restaurant and realised when I got home I’d been overcharged a significant amount. I went back the next day and complained in person, they said they’d take care of it. A few days later, I had to email following up as there’d been no contact, and they replied saying they agreed to the complaint and would refund the overcharged amount. It’s now a week later and no refund (and no responses to further emails). I’m intending to file a case with CASE, but is there any statutory authority I can report the restaurant to?

Best splurge meal in Singapore?,"I'll be coming round Singapore in a couple weeks, and am looking for one splurge meal to cap off my trip. I hope to be predominantly eating at hawker stalls, but was looking to set aside ~$150 SG (including tax + tip, and I don't need to drink) for an exceptional meal to cap off the trip.

Hoping to have something unique to Singapore (so ideally not French/Italian/Continental that I can get back home). If anyone here has had any exceptional meals, let me know!

(Also any other recommendations across budgets are welcomed :)",wjan2c,108,0.93,Discussion,2022-08-08 22:44:56+08:00,82,nlgc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/wjan2c/best_splurge_meal_in_singapore/,,False,False

Singaporean foods you can't find in Malaysia,"Malaysian here travelling to Singapore next week. Food has always been the mainstay of my travels but there's no way I'm travelling there just to eat... let's say food that I can find in abundance in Malaysia.

After some homework, here are some local Singaporean foods that (to my knowledge) are not common in Malaysia (we won't make a fuss if you claim these).

1. Singaporean Hokkien mee (fried prawn mee)
2. Bak chor mee
3. Katong laksa
4. Hainanese curry rice
5. Tze char (at least the phrase)
6. Satay bee hoon
7. EDIT: Fishball mee pok
8. EDIT: Tao suan (credits to [/u/Traditional\_Bell7883/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional_Bell7883/))
9. EDIT: Black chye tao kueh (credits to [/u/potatetoe\_tractor/](https://www.reddit.com/user/potatetoe_tractor/))
10. EDIT: Prawn vadai (credits to /u/aWitchonthisEarth)

I'm definitely gonna give all of them a try, so your suggestions on where to have them would be much appreciated!

"Went for an interview, one of the interviewers got really insulted that I negotiated for a slight increase.","I want a second opinion on this, so I wanted to share the full story of what actually happened.

I went for an interview for a job that was paying between 2.3 - 2.5k it was a 5.5 day job that was opened for people with 'no experience'.

I was quite excited about it and applied for the job, fast forward later I got a video interview. The video interview went well enough. 

What I learned about the job was it was a 'family business' and the interviewer (daughter) love highlighting the fact that their business paid better compared to other businesses and they had really long term workers who worked for them. Sounded good I thought. I said goodbye to the interviewer and looked forward to hearing again from her. 
 
Few days passed and I got a message to have a face to face appointment with another lady (mother), I accepted it, of course. I went there and learn the ins-and-outs of working there. It went well enough and there wasn't anything else to say about it other than the fact again, this older lady keeps highlighting the fact that their business paid more compared to other companies. 

After the tour we had a face to face to talk about certain expectations for the job, questions, and things like that. So first thing was 'notice period', I was currently a part time teacher, and I said my job, I need to give a months notice. The lady told me ""but part timers are usually 3 weeks notice, not one""
So I said, okay but the fact is I did check with my colleagues prior to this and they too agreed it was one month. I said to her, I will check with my boss again for confirmation.

After a few more questions and conversation, I brought up the issue of salary. As it was a 5.5 day job, I wanted to try negotiating a salary of 2.4 instead of the 2.3k, I asked if it was okay to have a salary of 2.4k instead or is 2.3k a fixed amount?, and she mentioned that because I had no experience in said job, I couldn't request for that amount. I just agreed, and didn't say much about it. 

So she was friendly throughout everything and I thought things went well for the time, I never got the vibe that anything was wrong. 

Few days later I got a message from the original interviewer (daughter) that told me 'I was the only candidate that never provided a notice period' and until I could provide a notice period and copy of my current job, I would not be considered. So I went to collect and shared my current contract that stipulated it was a '1 month' notice period, like I mentioned before. 

Few days later I got a message saying she wanted to talk to me again, and I agreed. 
When she called me in the evening I was honestly very shocked by her tone. She sounded so angry at me like I did something wrong. She started with ""What exactly did you say to make them so unhappy"". I explained my situation, I did not say anything that was untoward and I apologize profusely in case I did say anything wrong. 

Apparently she explained that asking for the salary increase had made then leave a bad impression of me, lady(mom) who was on a face to face interview with me had let the others know about me negotiating about the pay increase. According to her, they were really unhappy and said things like ""they are just a part timer with no experience, not even a full timer and still asking for 2.4k"" and also the fact I couldn't bring up my current job contract/notice (Again, please note I have mentioned my notice period during the interview originally)

I was honestly shock at how they reacted. I had to explain to her what exactly I had said and how I did not argue for the salary or anything, that I was fine with the current pay after her explanation. 
She had told me she will have to have a discussion with the rest and if I got rejected/accepted she will let me know. 

Anyways last night, I decided to withdrew from the job application. I felt it wasn't worth the headache to go through such a thing during the interview period. If they were acting this way and talking shit behind your back for the interview, why should I try to stay? 

For the record though, i would like to mention my previous full time jobs were 2.5k and they were 5 day jobs. This particular one wanted to pay 2.3k for a 5.5 day job. Also most of the job interviews I went to have never asked to see my current job contract, so I was also abit taken aback by the request.

Was I in the wrong? I just wanted to get this off my chest cause it was really bothering me last night. I would appreciate a 2nd opinion.

Edit: Since everyone seems to be curious, I was applying for a job related to healthcare.

Edit 2: I can't reveal the name of the company cause that'll be considered Doxxing lah bros, and I don't wanna get into trouble.
