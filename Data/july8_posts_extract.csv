Just wanted to say I appreciate all bus drivers, especially the awesome uncle who waited to close the bus doors for me so I could rush to the bus and board it in time :').",vu4edo,9,1.0,Opinion / Fluff Post,2022-07-08 14:48:40+08:00,3,55po5527,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vu4edo/nice_bus_drivers/,,False

20,Does Singapore have any online ADHD discussion or support groups? Looking for ADHD support/advice.,"I have been seeing a private psychatrist for over a year but I feel like the number of red flags with this doctor are increasing over time, so I was hoping to discuss it with other ADHD patients and find out if this stuff is normal, etc.

I pay about $150 for a 30 min consultation (i am not sure if this is the standard rate for private psychatrists here) but **most of it has very little to do with ADHD**, i think about 80% is him asking questions like ""what have you been up to lately?"" and then he will seize onto a topic about my life to talk about or he will start asking about my future plans, what industry i want to go into and stuff like that. 

One time, I happened to mention that I saw a doctor regarding a muscle pain issue and **he spent almost the entire session asking me questions about the muscle pain issue**. If i ask, he always insists it is related to ADHD because there may be an interaction, the human body is complex, he needs to know to treat me properly, etc.

ADHD topics are generally limited to ""so how are you doing on your current medication? ok? good."" and in the last few minutes he will rush to confirm the amount of medication he is prescribing me before quickly handing me over to the admin staff for payment and medication.

To be fair, i have been taking meds for more than 5 years (most of it spent overseas) and im stable on my current dosage anyway, so im not expecting him to run tests or whatever. But spending $150 on what is (mostly) a 30 min chit chat session which has little to do with ADHD feels wrong to me. **Is this kind of session standard for psychatrists here?**

**Another red flag is that he seems to take little to no notes of our sessions**. He will usually start the session by saying something like ""I remember we talked about X last session"", and I almost always have to correct him because he remembered wrongly. **I also have to remind him what medications he had recommended me last session**, he does not appear to write this kind of stuff down. Imagine the patient reminding the doctor about the medication he recommended, does that make sense?

And if I ask him to help me check something regarding a medication, he will never call or email me back, I have to remind him, and he always gives an answer like ""oh sorry, they couldn't suggest anything"" or ""oh sorry, i couldn't find any more information"", and it just sounds like he has forgotten it entirely and is making up a reply on the spot (of course i can't confirm what really happened, but it just feels that way to me).

Lots of other issues as well, like for example, i tried asking him to write a memo to another psychatrist to prove that i have been seeing him for ADHD treatment, and he refused to do so, **he claimed it is against the law to write memos** and there was a high profile case where a doctor got charged by the medical council for writing memos (this is obviously false). He insisted he will only provide a ""full medical report"" which i would have to pay for, but he also refused to disclose the cost when i asked (i suspect it is quite high) and told me to get the other psychatrist to request it from him first. 

I get the feeling he wants to make it difficult for me to switch doctors because I would have to pay for tests all over again at another doctor if i don't have a memo from him, and he charged me a lot of money for a simple MCQ test on my first visit (was a huge amount, i think like $50 or $80+ for a simple MCQ test).

**Im hoping to find other ADHD patients here to discuss my experiences and seek advice.**",vtex6l,34,0.86,Serious Discussion,2022-07-07 17:54:28+08:00,46,11hnt7w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vtex6l/does_singapore_have_any_online_adhd_discussion_or/,,False

36,A Bus Time Finder,"Hello there fellow Redditors!

&#x200B;

I have spent the past 3 months creating [something](https://vroomsg.vercel.app) that I would like to share with you guys :)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

It is a bus timing application, with a focus on Design and Usability as current applications do not seem to focus so much on design and its always functionality>design so, I wanted to explore the notion of bringing pure design to the forefront of everyones' hands!!

If you want to download the application for:

iOS: [App Store Link](https://apps.apple.com/app/vroomsg/id1633046369)Android: [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rach.codes.materialbusapp)Promotional website: [Website](https://vroomsg.vercel.app)

&#x200B;

**The long read**

The initial project was started due to the fact that I, at the given moment felt that the applications which exist are great and some of them adhere to great design principles such as [NextBusSG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themindstorm.nextbussg)(do check out his open source bus app too!), however, there aren't many applications out there that utilise both colour principles coupled with animations and as such, I set out on a journey which not only taught me how to build user interfaces which are easy to interact with but also how a slight difference in colour affects the way that the users react to the application. This coupled with rigorous user testings with my friends(thanks to the 50+ of you guys who tested the Alpha versions) of the application over the months that lead to the overall design.

&#x200B;

I really hope that this application would be beneficial to not only students who have the flexibility of getting their campus bus timings but also for the general public as the large fonts and clear colour indicators should aid in reaching the users, in the right way :)

&#x200B;

**About the application**

It is a rather simple application which displays bus timings around our precious little island, in an eloquent manner, which I believe has not been done yet. As the application is in its infancy, please do share your feedback too on what features which you would want added to the application to make it even more functional while retaining the simplicity that the application has!!

A few of the promotional materials would be passed down below, and the main functionalities of the application include the ability to add favourites, and there are plans to add many more themes too + more plans are below

&#x200B;

(\*for Android only\*)

You may double tap the *Vroom* icon to view your current balance for your ez-link card! iOS users would not be able to get this due to the restrictions posed by the iOS NFC SDK :(

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Future Plans**

There are also plans to finish the Apple Watch integration so that you guys would be able to utilise your wearables and for those who are tech-savvy I have also actually made a Flutter federated plugin which enables fellow Flutter developers to utilise the functionalities of the Apple Watch from within Flutter as well over here([https://github.com/justrach/watchify\_flutter](https://github.com/justrach/watchify_flutter))

&#x200B;

So the primary update schedule over the next two months is primarily:

\> WatchOS/Android Wear support

\> Viewing your Bus timings in AR<iOS only>

\> Bus Route support

&#x200B;

Edit 1: There is another update for iOS that would change the way the tutorial works so please stay tuned for that the android version is on the current stable version, however, if you would like to try the updated iOS version, please try join the beta test at:[https://testflight.apple.com/join/shrdpGDK](https://testflight.apple.com/join/shrdpGDK)

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Added support for MacOS too, you can now view the bus times on your Mac(M1 chip required)

&#x200B;

Edit 3: The changes for the application have been made as per the feedback with routes and a bus search function coming live before tomorrow ends so do keep your eyes peeled for it :)

Do join the betas to keep up with the changes!",vt5q9n,143,0.87,I Made This,2022-07-07 08:59:42+08:00,36,ircn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vt5q9n/a_bus_time_finder/,,False

I called IMH earlier today and was informed that IMH no longer has an adult ADHD specialist, and I will be referred to a general psychiatrist within 60-90 days. Given what I've read about IMH online, I don't feel very comfortable with what that implies...

Does anyone have recommendations for where else I can get subsidised treatment? For instance, I read that NUH has a psychology department that sees adult ADHD patients. I would be really grateful if anyone can share more about your experience with IMH/NUH or any other clinics, especially about the diagnosis process, cost of medicine and therapy sessions, and overall experience.

98,Any recommendations for psychologist/psychiatrist in the East? (For depression),"Hi everyone, asking for a friend here. 

Friend is going through an ugly divorce and have recently reached out regarding suspicions that she is experiencing signs of depression. 

If I understand it correctly I believe if we lookup the psych registry, they only list names of consultant individual so it is difficult to find out who actually specialises in depression etc.. Personally I donâ€™t know anyone that might be helpful so hoping this subreddit can help. 

Preferences : 

1.	Female consultant
2.	Face-to-face
3.	Anywhere in the East
4.	Preferably consultations that involve machines (that help with depression? i.e. Positive psychology maybe)

Sheâ€™s open to seeing both psychologist/psychiatrist. No real budget constraints for now. 

I just want her to get regular help asap. Greatly appreciate any recommendations along with any tips on spotting worsening signs of depression!

          I know this is a sensitive topic and works like to ask for practical advice. My sibling is thinking of meeting his Malay muslim girlfriend and he is rather confused ( so am i) about the rules. He does not want to convert to her religion and she does not want to convert to ours (Taoism). I understand in the past that, if one spouse is Muslim the other spouse had to convert to Islam. Is this true? And in this day and age are the marriages between non muslims and Muslims without any conversion? I hope i did not offend anyone. Please admin, if this topic too sensitive please delete.
