12,Getting diagnosed for Adult ADHD - IMH/NUH/Private/Anywhere else?,"I've suspected that I have inattentive type ADHD for a long time, and I've finally decided to get an official diagnosis and professional help. I would prefer to go via the subsidised public option given the long term cost of medication, but I'm not opposed to private if there are no suitable options.

I called IMH earlier today and was informed that IMH no longer has an adult ADHD specialist, and I will be referred to a general psychiatrist within 60-90 days. Given what I've read about IMH online, I don't feel very comfortable with what that implies...

Does anyone have recommendations for where else I can get subsidised treatment? For instance, I read that NUH has a psychology department that sees adult ADHD patients. I would be really grateful if anyone can share more about your experience with IMH/NUH or any other clinics, especially about the diagnosis process, cost of medicine and therapy sessions, and overall experience.
