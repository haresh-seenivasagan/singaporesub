100,Curious about change in expat demography in Singapore,"This is a totally random question, but I'd like to know if anybody is interested to explain.

To give context, I used to live in Singapore for study and work back during 2007-2012. Stayed mostly in city center (Bugis, Clarke Quay, Orchard, City Hall etc). And at the time I left SG, I could hardly find any Anglo-Euro-foreigners/expats walking around the streets of Singapore. Even in drinking hotspots, they're not that easy to look for.

Then came 2015 or so. I came back for a holiday to SG and was totally shocked to see the number of Anglo-Euro-foreigners have dramatically increased in the city center. It's like I can hardly walk down the streets without seeing at least a dozen of them in sight.

I hope I don't sound racist, but I am genuinely curious. Why was this happening? Was there any sort of drastic change of foreign policies or something of that nature that stimulated a significant increase of Anglo/Euro foreigners in general?",vo4dgv,2,0.52,Discussion,1656581878.0,26,gunduldulpacul,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vo4dgv/curious_about_change_in_expat_demography_in/,,False

131,career as a (female) pilot?,"hi, ive been looking into careers and i’ve been really really interested in pursing a career as a pilot, commercial maybe. 

i was just wondering what routes i can take to be a pilot right after JC? i’m currently in the sci stream, am i at a disadvantage for not studying anything related to aviation or aerospace engineering? i’m not sure about the pre-requisites, like will my a level results play a big factor? 

i’ve also been worried that i may be too short as im currently about 158cm. ive looked into SYFC memberships but got bummed out when i saw that one of the requirements was that i’d have to be at least 162cm🥲 

 i’ve also found this: https://www.reviongroundschool.com/scholarship and i’m pretty interested in this scholarship and would like to prepare for it already but it seems like not much information is provided

would it be advisable for me to go to ns after jc? i heard i could get free training in saf then later go to commercial but is there any other routes? i’m currently a pr, but i’ve already applied for singapore citizenship a while ago and am still waiting for an approval. i assume it would be necessary for me to be sgean to even consider scholarships right?

im sorry for all the questions but any sort of guidance would be appreciated!! thanks😭

edit: i know more now thanks to all the responses, and i also know now that it seems i’m unfortunately lacking the height to be a pilot here. thank you guys for the help! :))",vne4ng,2,0.52,Discussion,1656504040.0,29,yousuckbye,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vne4ng/career_as_a_female_pilot/,,False

158,moving to singapore,"Hey guys

So I've been looking to move my family out of the UK, there's nothing particularly bad about living here but there is nothing particularly great either. Living in the UK is very stable but chances are you are going to have an incredibly average life.

On paper, Singapore seems like a great option. As I understand it pretty much everybody speaks English and it's used as the primary language in most professional settings? 

A beautiful country, one of if not the cleanest country in the world with incredibly low crime rates and great education opportunities.

I have a few concerns that I'm hoping you guys can answer though!

How in general are foreigners treated in Singapore?  Our plan would be to make a life there and obviously this would play an important part in how things went.

How likely are foreigners to get low-ish skilled jobs? I work as a stock controller in a warehouse which generally doesn't need qualifications as such, but prior experience in similar roles. My partner works in customer service.

I understand the majority of people live in high rise buildings, are regular houses incredibly expensive? We would definitely rather live in a house or maybe a small block of flats with garden access.

We currently have a mortgage and if we were to sell our house we would have around £50,000 (84,978 singapore dollar), although we are debating not selling our house and just renting it for about £700 (1189 singapore dollar) a month. Would the sale of our home be a decent deposit to one day buy a house there? If we were to rent would 1189 be a good additional income along with our jobs?

Would you say it's a requirement to learn Malay? We have absolutely no problem learning another language but if there is basically nobody who regularly speaks Malay then we would of course make it less of a priority.

Anything else you think we should know?

2. Are there places that are considered buskers' territory? Like, perhaps in the middle of night markets or in time square? What places can you go where you will be able to see plenty of buskers? Are there plenty of buskers around?

3. Are food delivery with bicycles a thing? Is it common? What delivery food service will you often see (i.e, Grabfood, FoodPanda)?

I am a Malaysian and I don't exactly know how Singapore is like ^~^' I would imagine it'll be similar to here, but I am looking for more more detailed answers, specifically details about spots busy with buskers and such. Please help a fellow neighbour out, thank you!

This post is all over the place as the subject matter jumps around a lot, but there's too much content in here for the daily thread.*

1: **What do you think are the most powerful ministerial portfolios and why?**

I don't see this question being bandied about a lot. While in certain areas it may seem obvious, I may be surprised. If possible, name your top 4.

Because I love to categorize things, I've also included my personal categorization of our Cabinet ministers by power and influence.

|*Tier*|*Ministr(ies)*|*Current minister(s)*|*Notes*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|***""You don't CB me, I'm the PM""***|Prime Minister's Office (PMO)|Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister|Of course he's at the top LOL|
|***""Respect your Seniors""***|Anywhere the PM tells you (usually 80-90% of everything)|Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister/Coordinating Minister for National Security; Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister/Coordinating Minister for Social Policies|Also, Tharman is still [chairman of MAS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Board-of-Directors) so he is still DPM Lawrence's boss in at least one place. SM position gives them symbolic authority, CM gives them the power|
|***""You either won at life for 4G or you lost, GG""***|Your ministry + anywhere the PM tells you, except when the Seniors sabo you|Lawrence Wong, DPM and Finance Minister (PM-in-waiting), Heng Swee Keat, DPM and CM for Economic Policies|One won, one lost because his East Coast Plan needs him AHAHHAHAHHAHAHA (for real though: good luck for your future HSK)|
|**The Big Five (Finance, Defence, Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Law)**|Your ministry. If you in cabinet for 100 yrs you get to stick finger everywhere else if PM lets you|Ng Eng Hen, Defence; K. Shanmugam, Home Affairs/Law; Vivian Balakrishnan, Foreign Affairs|These five pillars are the bedrock of administrating the company that is Singapore.

2: **What do you think about two-position Ministers who have to commute between HQs in one day?**

[I watched this video of K. Shanmugam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6vNQhY-sYw) a while back, and thought about something. Some replies to my previous question ask how ministers do so many jobs at once. K. Shanmugam has to commute between MHA headquarters in [New Phoenix Park](https://www.mha.gov.sg/contact-us) *and* the Law Ministry at [High Street](https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ministries/minlaw), presumably every day. How about ministers like Maliki Osman, who's Second Minister for two ministries (MOE and MFA)? Do they have to commute between three HQs and split their mind every day?

3: **Why Second Ministers and not Deputy Ministers?**

I've answered similar queries with my own thoughts before, but now I ask the rest. Why use the term ""Second Minister"", for someone who's already a Minister for another ministry, rather than a separate ""Deputy Minister""? The term ""Second Minister"" implies a second, competing boss at the Ministry all the time.

4: **Who could be Deputy Prime Minister, Senior Minister, or Coordinating Minister(s) in a Lawrence Wong cabinet?**

[PM Lee mentions that Lawrence Wong will pick his deputy ""in due course""](https://mothership.sg/2022/04/dpm-choice-by-lawrence-wong/). After the whole debate about the next PM, now we should move to who LW will pick as a deputy prime minister. Will he pick one, or two? Who? Will the new DPM(s) also head a ministry at the same time? Which ministry?

As for Senior Ministers, highly doubt TCH and Tharman will stay for Wong's full tenure. Assuming Lawrence fills these posts as PM (they've been vacant for long stretches before), who do you think will be selected? Why? And who will succeed TCH, Tharman and HSK and Coordinating Ministers for National Security, Social Policies and Economic Policies respectively?

By tricycles, I mean the kind for adults that look like what vans are to cars, with one basket in front and one in the back plus an extra seat for a passenger.

What's the reason behind this? If I'm not wrong, trikes of various types are more common in other countries...

Also, on noticing this, I got the idea of maybe buying one for my own use since I have poor balance and need a short range transport to get around the neighbourhood and get groceries. However, when I went online to research where to get it, I notice that its mainly sold on Lazada, Shoppee and Carousell. One would have thought that the bike shops would come up first...

199,Why are TransCab drivers so awful,"Saturday evening, I was taking an evening walk with my partner on the road in my neighbourhood estate (totally normal *edit: quiet landed estate near a park where people do their walks, pavement doesn’t always make sense because of garden overgrowth in that area as well), when this TransCabbie suddenly drives up to the back of us, and sounds his horn aggressively. It’s almost 11 p.m., there’s literally no one else on the other side of the road, and we weren’t even blocking him. 

Of course we’re pissed and we make hand gestures. 

The TransCabbie turns into a condo nearby and disappears in to drop his fare. 

We walk on... and just when you think that’s it, damned TransCabbie comes up to us a few mins later to sound his horn some more and flip us off?? 

I still can’t wrap my head around this level of pettiness and sh*ttiness. Also, to come flip us off, the guy had to make a detour deeper into our neighbourhood. Like he wasn’t hurting from the fuel price hikes.

==========

Welp, this week was fun. (Details are in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vflwq8/beyond_uniqlo_a_stepbystep_style_guide_for_sg/).)Thank you, everyone here in r/SG, for the awards, upvotes, and shares.

So, onwards to the topic of the week - **White T-shirts!**

## Wait, whut, why?!

* Everyone needs a white tee, and it's the foundation of every wardrobe.
   * For those of you who really hate white tees, you can apply the same tips but opt for greys, blacks, or off-whites. That said, it's still highly recommended that you have at least one, as it's the easiest to coordinate.
* I wanted to give y'all a sense of how far the rabbit hole can go.
* You will understand why choosing colour may be the easier option. Here's an analogy. You know how the simpler the dish, the better the ingredients and the cooking techniques need to be. Well, the white tee is the white rice of your wardrobe. Welcome to rice-cooking 101!

There are many types of T-shirts - [Polo tees](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/polo-shirt_1028307.htm), [Raglan tees](https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/young-handsome-man-wearing-white-grey-raglan-t-shirt_9680484.htm), [Henley tees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_shirt), etc... For various combinations of collars, lengths, and fit. There are something like 10+ styles. We'll focus on the most **basic classic white tee** and the **oversized white tee**, because the other variants can have very specific requirements for the wearer's build.

How do you decide which of these two to wear? Look at your body shape.

## The 5 classic body shapes

Reference Image:  [https://imgur.com/0B2GJgb](https://imgur.com/0B2GJgb)

The shapes are based on the relative proportions of your body. Usually, you'll be able to tell by looking at yourself (naked) in the mirror. But you should measure to be sure.

Measure the circumference of your shoulder, chest, waist and hips with a measuring tape. **Which of these apply?**

1. Is your hip the broadest? Is your waist thicker than your shoulder by at least 3cm? >!You're a Triangle. (Aka Pear shaped)!<
2. Is your waist at least 3cm thicker than your hip and shoulder? >!You're an Oval. (Aka Apple shaped)!<
3. Are all 4 measurements within 3cm of each other? (Especially the waist vs chest.) >!You're a Rectangle.!<
4. Is your waist the slimmest?

* Yes, and your shoulders are more than 5cm thicker than your hips. >!You're an Inverted Triangle.!<
* Yes, but your shoulders are less than 5cm thicker than your hips. >!You're a Trapezoid.!<

**Note:**

* There are more detailed models for body shapes, but this basic guide will suffice for now. I'll do a deep dive into silhouettes later on.
* Traditionally, stylists will make recommendations that sculpt you into that masculine, inverted triangle shape. Depending on your body shape, it can add up to a lot of work and/or solutions that aren't viable for everyday comfort. Thus, I've modified some of the recommendations here to encourage more diversity and comfort.

&#x200B;

||Basic|Oversized|Remarks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Triangle 🔺|x||You will want a standard fit, not too tight. HOWEVER - If you see an oversized tee with a little bit of shoulder padding or structure, PLEASE AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY. It may unlock a whole new world for you.|
|Inverted Triangle 🔻|x||Yeah, you have the ultra-masculine build, especially if you work out. Try Raglan tees too, especially if you find the sleeve-armpit area of standard tees constricting. Unless you're REALLY toned, go for a normal-to-slim fit.; NOT skin-tight fit. EXCEPTION: If you're broad-shouldered BUT thin, you can give Oversized tees with softer fabrics a try.|
|Trapezoid|x|x|Congratulations, you have the classic average build. Means you can try both. If you're a bit toned, or have a compact build, go for the basic. If you're not toned, or want a more bookish/""herbivorous"" aesthetic, go with the oversized.|
|Oval||x|The fabric should be of moderate stiffness. (Should not be too thin, otherwise, it will cling to your contours too closely.) Resist the urge to go for overly baggy clothes, and the sleeve should NOT go beyond your elbow. Work with a tailor if you have to.|
|Rectangle|x|?|You CAN try both options. BUT. You have a slim/compact/long build, you can differentiate yourself by rocking that lean beanpole look. Especially if you are long-limbed too.|

**Who else should try Basic:** People who work out regularly (Shape is secondary here; you worked hard to build that muscle tone.)

**Who else should try Oversized:** People who have sloped shoulders (Yes, this is for keyboard warriors with shitty postures.)

## Time for a case study

Introducing my favourite ~~muse-cum-model~~ guinea pig u/Echlori!

Some basic info:

* 177cm, 70-72kg, Trapezoid build
* His ""imperfections"" include: Slight belly, sloped shoulder, not much muscle tone, roughly 5:5 torso/leg ratio, poorly defined jawline... (\*eyeroll\* The beauty standards really last warning ah.)

Photo:  [https://imgur.com/KFpiGuY](https://imgur.com/KFpiGuY)

A: Classic fugly polo tee. Literally, everything looks better in comparison. It even gave my guinea pig moobs!!! (Note: There are EXCELLENT polo tees. But writing a guide on it will need another 1000 words from me and a lot of legwork from you. So, let's skip? LOL)

B: Not the right tee for him due to the cutting; even the S size didn't align right with his shoulders. But people with broader shoulders (Inverted Triangle or Trapezoid build) can try.

C: Overall cutting looks good. But the pocket is a few mm away from perfection, and he didn't like the skin feel of the fabric. Otherwise, the base silhouette is better than option D.

D: The fabric wasn't comfortable either. The cutting also didn't do anything for his belly, and the overall shape visually adds 10 kg to his body.

E: Looks like option D, doesn't it? Nope, it ain't. Coz the fabric is softer and thinner. Combined with the slightly too-oversized cut, he looks ready for bed.

F: I had to photoshop this one to censor his nipples. A classic example of a fabric that is extremely comfortable for sports but too clingy for polite company. Can consider getting a dark/coloured version of it.

**G: He bought** [**this one**](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E452399-000?colorCode=COL00)**.** Because the shirt had shoulder seams that align with his shoulders, had the right thickness for SG, and the fabric had the right level of stiffness. Didn't quite pass the scrunch test, but we can't expect perfection at $14.90, right?

## Considerations, and better options for certain body features

* For most people, pick tees with moderately soft/stiff fabrics. If the fabric is too stiff, it'll create a boxy effect. Too soft, it'll show off all your curves. (Yes, including your durian baby.)
* Slip your hand under the shirt. If you can see the contours through one layer of fabric, don't buy. It's definitely too thin and/or too soft. (Unless you want to show off your nipples?)
* Try more than one size. (Usually, it's up instead of down.) Why: When sizing changes, the dimensions don't always change in the same/proportionate amount! Sometimes, you will be pleasantly surprised if you size up.
* Choose a standard V-neck collar (NOT a deep V, thank you) or wider collars, if you have broad shoulders and/or thick/short necks
* Try Raglan tees if you have really broad/juicy shoulders.
* For people with narrow shoulders (Triangle shape people especially), try a smaller collar, or the Henley collar. Also, feel the seam that connects the collar to the sleeve. (The one that runs along your shoulders.) If it feels stiffer or is reinforced, PLEASE TRY IT.

At this point, you have learned enough to pick out a decent white tee. Combined with the simple colour test in [my previous guide](https://medium.com/@fureifurei/beyond-uniqlo-a-step-by-step-style-guide-for-sg-dudes-2e84f37e32eb), you can now pick out suitable colour tees too. Hop off if you wish.🙂

Now, for the perfectionists here...

## ""White"" is not white

Let's do an exercise together right now.

Look up from your screen, and pay REALLY close attention to where your home's walls meet the ceiling. Nope. It's not your imagination. For most of us, the whites will be different. Because painters usually use a default white paint that is ideal for ceilings, which is an actually-white white. While your walls can be any of these: [https://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/design/reno-tips/reno-tips-choosing-the-right-shade-of-white/](https://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/design/reno-tips/reno-tips-choosing-the-right-shade-of-white/)

Bonus off-topic tip - If you're ever unsure about which white to choose for your home's walls, I wholeheartedly recommend Nippon Paint's Lily White (1137). Why? It gives a subtle touch of warmth, goes well with wood furniture, and it ages gracefully. (Yeah, the colour of your wall will gradually change over the years, due to the environment.)

**Now back to white t-shirts!**

Just like wall paints, the whites of t-shirts can be subtly different. (You can gather all the white tees in your home and compare.)

Look at option G in the case study. The colour is strangely coherent with him, isn't it?

Now look at option F. You will notice that there's just something slightly jarring about that white. That's because option F is a cool white, while my dear guinea pig is clearly warm-toned.

**Liddat how?**

Luckily for you, you live in Singapore. Meaning you can choose slightly thinner and breathable fabrics. This means they are VERY slightly translucent, and will subtly blend with your skin tone. **So, just pick white fabrics that suit our climate and it usually won't be too bad.**

There is, however, a limit to this ""cheat"". Plus, if you choose thicker or more opaque fabrics, the coolness/warmth of the white will be EVEN more obvious. i.e. when you pick white shirts.(Those of you who had white school uniforms, remember how some first-year students just look weird? YUP. A lot of times, it's because the white doesn't suit their skin.)

**Wanna learn how to choose your whites and off-whites?** Stick around for my next article, which will dive deep into colours. After that, I'll continue with guides for these basics: Chino Shorts, Jeans, White shirt, Blazers, Pants.

## Closing remarks

* **Your ""white tee"" does not literally have to be a white tee.** Mark Zuckerberg's white tee is a grey tee. Steve Jobs' white tee was Issey Miyake's Semi-Dull black mock turtleneck (\~SGD350 per piece). Mine is currently a $10 black padded shoulder tee from a fast fashion brand that I won't mention.

We could have music from bands like Green Day, Linkin Park, AC/DC, Guns n Roses, maybe more modern rock bands like Crashing Atlas. Then if they want softer rock they can go for perhaps Radiohead, Eagles, Nirvana and stuff.

243,A Love Letter to Singapore," 

A long time ago, in a Southern Province of China…

My first memories of Singapore were of the show Under One Roof. There weren’t a lot of English TV options back then, and something about the dysfunctional but loving Tan family resonated with me, a lonely kid in a far off province of his own. Sure, we had little in common - I, ten years old, an American, not knowing his dim sum from his durian, they using exotic words like kiasu and Mee Rebus. But something about the love the family had for each other, the patience and forgiveness with their foibles, the idea that no matter what happened in that half hour, everything would work out ok - that resonated with me.

Over the next ten years, I came to learn that the show represented everything there is to love about Singapore. The love for family, the inherent safety of existing in a country that provides for its people, the celebration of diversity, the kindness and generosity of its people - this is what I came to discover in my time there. And despite being an Ang Mo, despite despising Rojak and Otah Otah, Singapore has stolen my heart and will hold it forever.

My formative years were spent in what would be shocking levels of independence here in the States - romping through Lower Pierce Reservoir, riding my bike to the arcade in Yishun, playing capture the flag on Mt. Faber long before it had a cable car. Singapore gave me the freedom to be a child in safety. Later, she gave me the foundational experiences of a young man, falling in love while sitting on the rooftop of the Esplanade, watching what stars we could see through the city lights. She gave me my first heartbreak when that love moved away, and distance took its toll. She gave me friendship like I’ve never known since, forged playing Counter Strike in $5 LAN cafes, and street soccer matches in the HDB void deck, and long days watching the tankers float by off the East Coast. She taught me that Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus can live in mutual respect and understanding, and that whatever differences might exist between us are far outweighed by our shared experiences as people. She taught me to be a responsible adolescent with a healthy respect for the law and for my fellow citizens, and to show mad respect to Auntie when she yells at me for kicking a ball into her yard. She taught me, through the ever changing Expat communities, how to make new friends fast, and how to say see you later without saying goodbye. She taught me empathy, patience, and forgiveness, all through the people I met in the hawker center, or on the MRT, or down my street. In short, she made me the person I am today. And it is why I keep coming back, year after year, even though circumstances have kept me from living there full time, which will always be my dream. It’s why I will always see Singapore as my true home. 

I know Singapore isn’t perfect. The ugly tendrils of the world’s culture wars have begun to seep in - frustration with the trajectory of the society,  a lack of faith in social and governmental systems, and most disturbingly, racial tension. And I recognize there is a tendency to focus on the negatives - I see it plenty on this forum- and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Without criticism, there can’t be growth. But at the same time, I’ve felt that Singapore sometimes has a sort of insecurity to it, that because it is small, it has to constantly change and innovate, to be bigger, shinier, more glamorous, more competitive, more….more. But you are enough now. You are a model of what so many places could and should be. You are not your casinos or your rooftop bars, but your values and your people. And you are beautiful.

Under One Roof might be long gone, but the sense of place it evoked remains. And I hope to return and remain some day as well. Love to you all.",vk7vyd,576,0.92,Opinion / Fluff Post,1656135186.0,70,listsoffury,688,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vk7vyd/a_love_letter_to_singapore/,,False

267,So I wrote this to my MP the other day...,"Hi XXX (name withheld)

&#x200B;

We spoke last evening about our thoughts on the repeal of 377A. You said that if you had to vote on this issue you would vote not to repeal 377A based on the moral guidance of your Christian faith. I was dismayed, and as I mulled over your justifications later that evening, and even today, my feeling shifted from dismay to perturbed. Yes, I am perturbed if that is your reason. Let me explain why.

&#x200B;

1. The Christian faith as in all religions, preaches many things. Some are universally good, some are simply untenable in today’s world - I mean, the Bible does say a lot about rights to own slaves, divorce and (the lack of) women’s rights. So are you consistent enough to rely on your faith when it comes to every issue put on a vote, or do you conveniently single out certain beliefs from your faith to suit your own bias and perceptions?

&#x200B;

2. It is precisely your faith that opposes and oppresses the LGBTQ community at large. One just need to observe comments and motivations made within the faith community to understand the constant onslaught of discrimination and threats against the LGBTQ family. So by relying on your moral conscience to your faith to make a decision that continues to oppress and make unequal a gay person’s standing in his society, have you abandoned your moral conscience of many others (amongst which are your constituents as well) to strive for a more equal society? As I reiterated last night, we are not taking away rights from  the heteronormative society, there is nothing they lose by us gaining a bit of dignity in our lives.

&#x200B;

3. I stand by what I said last night that an MP elected by his constituents should be representing the voice of his constituency instead of being guided by his personal beliefs. Otherwise, why bother even having Meet The People sessions? The whole point of the MPS is for the MP to listen, understand the ground and grievances of the constituents, and represent their voices in parliament. I completely understand that one issue can have many voices and opposing opinions. Then I feel as an MP, his vote should always be - always be - to be on the side of the disenfranchised. I have presented to you enough reasons why the LGBTQ community is constantly at a disadvantage and losing end of so many other laws and regulations that support a heteronormative family that typing them all down here just overwhelms me negatively even further. How much real and tangible disadvantages will the conservatives incur on the other hand, from a repeal of a law that although isn’t enforced legally, is being wielded by them “because it is still there” to justify their continual discrimination? None. But they do get less intangible weight when imposing their belief system on others.

&#x200B;

Lastly, my example of the analogy of a wealthy MP voting against the appeal from his poorer constituents to raise taxes for the rich because he is reluctant to lose his wealth is very real and relevant. You said “But who would do that?” Yet this is happening around the world, even in Singapore. I believe an opposition party wrote this - “We will continue to argue against the proposed GST increase in parliament, as well as for alternative forms of revenue generation, such as wealth taxes…”

&#x200B;

Have a think about what I have put down here. Again, I sincerely appeal to you to listen to the LGBTQ voices on the ground to have a better understanding of the real struggles they face in their daily lives, and the lament of the potential they could have achieved if they were given a little more equality.",viu35t,34,0.59,Politics,1655981374.0,56,deuter72,3062,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/viu35t/so_i_wrote_this_to_my_mp_the_other_day/,,False

283,Traveling to Malaysia with 35mm film,"I do film photography as a hobby. I'll be traveling to Malaysia by bus and decided to bring my camera and some rolls along to document the sites. From what I've read, the carry-on luggage scanners shouldn't do too much to ISO 200-400 film and I've also seen that some people request for a hand-check by the security officers rather than bringing them through the scanners. Are these possible at SG and JB customs (specifically the ones at the Causeway)? Or are there any other things to take note of?


P.S Hello to anyone finding this post in the future. I've returned from my trip and guess I'd share what the experience was like. Basically very smooth and simple. I carried my film and camera with me in its own bag and it was just a matter of taking them out of the bag before it entered the scanner and explaining that I had photographic film. Customs on both sides were accommodating and simply waved me through once I told them about it. Only difference between SG and Malaysia is that SG has a metal detector and pat-down whereas Malaysia does not, but it didn't affect anything about the film.

306,"Migrant worker advocate who did not get work pass renewed made misleading, false public posts: MOM"," 

SINGAPORE - A migrant worker who was active in local literary circles and founded two community groups here has left Singapore after his work permit expired and was not renewed.

In a Facebook post on Wednesday (June 22), Mr Zakir Hossain Khokan, 43, said the system had initially reflected an ""adverse record with a government agency"".

He was later told that this was an administrative error and that his work permit was ""ineligible"" for renewal, he said.

Responding to media queries, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said it takes into account various factors when assessing an applicant's suitability to work in Singapore and for work passes to be renewed.

The ministry noted that by Mr Zakir's own account, Singapore has allowed him to work here for 19 years.

""Through his time in Singapore, he has written often about migrant workers here. We renewed his work pass many times despite his activism and writings,"" said MOM.

 ""We draw the line, however, when public posts are misleading, false or deliberately provocative.""   


""It cited a Facebook post that Mr Zakir made last October in the wake of unrest at Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory that drew riot police to the scene.

Police had responded to a call for assistance at the dorm after a confrontation between workers and management over poor quality food and long delays in transporting workers with Covid-19 to recovery and healthcare facilities.

While Special Operations Command officers were on standby, the Ministry of Home Affairs said then that additional police units were not deployed and no arrests were made by the police durting the incident.

MOM said Mr Zakir had called migrant workers in Singapore ""work slaves"", and dormitories here ""work camps"", and also alleged that soldiers and armoured vehicles had surrounded the dorm.

""This was a false characterisation,"" MOM said. ""There were no soldiers, let alone armoured vehicles, around.""

The ministry added that Mr Zakir's statements could have incited migrant workers at the dorm and elsewhere, inflamed their emotions and possibly caused incidents of public disorder.

It added: ""The ability of a foreigner to work in Singapore is not an entitlement. Mr Zakir has been permitted to work in Singapore for a long time, though he was a long-time activist.

""His work pass has since expired. He cannot prolong his stay when he no longer has a job in Singapore. He has over-stayed his welcome.""

The ministry also noted that while Mr Zakir had appealed the decision by the Controller of Work Passes that his work pass was ineligible for renewal, his employer did not appeal. The appeal was considered and MOM informed him that it was unsuccessful.

A former freelance journalist and poet, Mr Zakir returned to his home in Bangladesh on June 15 after working in Singapore's construction sector for nearly two decades.

During his time here, he founded literary interest group Migrant Writers of Singapore and started ""One Bag, One Book"", a book-sharing project for foreign workers here that later helped to distribute supplies to migrant workers living in dorms when Covid-19 struck.

Mr Zakir took the first prize for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 in the Migrant Worker Poetry Competition organised by Banglar Kantha, a newspaper here for the Bangladeshi community.

Mr Zakir said in his Facebook post that he received notice from his employer's human resources department on May 24 that his work permit could not be renewed.

""I went to my site office and realised that I couldn't access the building. I called my HR and they told me that my work permit could not be renewed,"" he told ST

Mr Zakir, who declined to name the employer, added: ""It was so sudden and unexpected.""

Appeals made on his behalf by several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals, including MP Louis Ng and former NMP Anthea Ong, were not successful. This is according to a letter seen by The Straits Times that was sent to Manpower Minister Tan See Leng requesting a closed-door meeting to seek clarifications.

Ms Ong, who met Mr Zakir five years ago at a community event by her social enterprise Hush TeaBar, told ST that he had approached her for help after he got news that his work pass was not being renewed.

She asked him to appeal directly to MOM and also agreed to write a letter to Dr Tan to outline Mr Zakir's contributions to the migrant worker community.

Ms Ong said she asked for the reasons why Mr Zakir's work permit was not renewed but MOM did not give one.

She noted that MOM has been doing good work in engaging NGOs and migrant workers since it set up a new division called the Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group in 2020 to care for migrant workers here.

""I hope this matter will not affect ACE's efforts nor discourage our migrant brothers and sisters from coming forward to volunteer or create initiatives to support fellow migrant workers,"" said Ms Ong.

I've been diagnosed by the guys at REACH midway through secondary school and was wondering how i would follow up/ seek treatment from other ways and if any of you have experiences. I heard getting a diagnosis and treatment of adhd for females is harder, so atleast ive gotten past the first hurdle

I kind of feel ashamed to admit this....but going into tertiary education adhd has been making it hell for me, I can barely keep up....not because I dont understand the work but because adhd has made it more and more difficult to cope with the work and its starting to mess up my ability to function as a human being as a whole, be it forgetting to do basic stuff like take care of my hygiene or just keeping my stuff tidy and in order. So its kind of urgent as its feeling pretty shitty to live like this.

Also almost forgot to note but thankfully my family is in support of me seeking treatment

========

There are way too many dudes who kena the feedback of ""You look too plain/boring/uniqlo/fugly"". I don't think it's fair to call our local dudes ugly or lazy; they're busy balancing the (unfair) societal expectation of being/becoming providers and the human need of having a life. So here's a step-by-step style guide.

This guide has 5 parts:

1. Your Colours
2. Choosing Fabrics
3. Cuttings
4. Coordinating Outfits
5. Wardrobe Curation & Shopping

## Part 1: Your Colours

Notice how Uniqlo's clothes look so good on the model, but so plain on commoners? Well, Uniqlo is mass market, so the clothes need to look decent on everyone, but not necessarily make anyone look exceptional. That said, you will find stuff that makes you look extra good at Uniqlo (and other shops), once you know which colours flatter you. If anything, it's now the season to try colours, after 2 years of WFH-induced moodiness.

**Simplest litmus test:** Borrow your family's jewellery. Find 1 silver and 1 gold piece. The chunkier, the better, and try to make sure both pieces have a similar lustre. Then place them against your face, and see which one makes you look more radiant.

* If the silver looks better, you have a **cool undertone**. Your colours are blue-green, blue, purple. Basically, anything from Grab delivery bag green to recycling bin blue to eggplant purple.
* If you look better with gold,  you have a **warm undertone**.  Red, orange, yellow, yellow-green. Think fire engine red to M1 orange to lemon yellow.
* If you look ok with both,  you have a **neutral undertone**. Congratulations, you'll look ok in many colours, but you'll need to try harder to be exceptional.

No women around to lend you jewellery? Borrow your bros and do this exercise together. If you look better (less cui) in the Army No.4, you're warm undertoned. If you look better in the RSAF No.4, you're cool undertoned. (DW, I'll mention the Navy No.4 later.)

Once you know this, you can start experimenting with colour saturation and brightness.

Cool-toned people: Try pastel blue, blue grey, bright blue, and navy blue. Once you find the types of blue that make you look good, find the green/purple version of it.

Warm-toned people: Try pastel sakura pink (yes, if LHL can wear pink, so can you), ashy-grey-red, brick red, fire engine red, and burgundy red. Same logic as the cool-toned people.

Neutral-toned people: Try pastel-mint, tiffany blue, and dark teal. Or, if your skin is a bit more yellow, try the warm-toned colours. More pink, try cool-toned.

Folks who look good in the Navy No.4, you're probably really fair or really dark. This means you can try bold and saturated colours, so go for it.

**WAIT A MINUTE, where are my neutrals?!**

Easy. Warm-toned people - go for browns and khaki. Cool-toned people can go cool grey, monochrome, or navy. Neutral-toned people, just match based on the above. (You can also try warm greys and cool browns.)

Apply the same logic to your shoes; assuming you have a finite budget, you can't go wrong with neutral-coloured shoes. I also recommend getting bags and belts that are the same colour as your shoes. (It'll make coordinating outfits so much easier.)

## Part 2: Choosing Fabrics

Yeah, we're all lazy people living busy lives in a hot and expensive country. So, our clothes need to match these keywords: breathable, wrinkle-resistant, and good value. A few pointers for tops.

* Litmus test: Scrunch up the fabric in your hands. If it looks like a primary school kid's worksheet when you straighten it again, don't buy it. (Idk about y'all, but if a piece of clothing can't look decent with just a quick steam, I'm not buying it.)
* Reach into the middle of the pile/stack of the tops. If it doesn't feel warm, you can buy it. (Doesn't count if the items are right under a super cold aircon vent ah.)
* 100% cotton isn't a guarantee of breathability/comfort/performance; at lower price brackets, cotton blends are usually better. (Take a look at the Airism label.) This rule of thumb will start to go out of the window when you look at tops that cross $50.
* If you insist on 100% cotton, pay attention to the thickness. Contrary to conventional wisdom in seasonal countries, breathableness trumps durability every time.
* Linen (blends) are AWESOME for comfort, but usually not wrinkle-resistant at a lower price point. Do the scrunch test; if you find a plain linen shirt that looks good on you, is opaque enough to censor your nips (even in cold rooms), doesn't wrinkle (much), AND is within your budget, just buy 2 pieces in different colours. Then repurchase more if you really love it and it's in very good condition after 5-10 washes.

Pants and bottoms are a whole different ball game and probably require a whole separate guide. Let's just talk about finding comfortable casual long pants.

Visit shops that do outdoor/camping/hiking clothes. Then look for pants that don't wrinkle badly (scrunch test!). Also, bonus points if the pants are convertible (the leg portions can be detached); idk how to describe how amazing those are on rainy days. **You should also check out the hiking shirts there.** Even more bonus points if the pants' cutting fit your frame nicely.

# Part 3: Cuttings

Let's start with **t-shirts**.

* The sleeves need to start where your shoulder ends. Unless you're really into the skateboarder aesthetic (or have a very specific set of body proportions), the sleeve-to-shoulder seam should land nicely on the edge of your shoulders.
* The thicker/shorter your neck and the broader your shoulder, the wider your collar needs to be. V collars work too. (Buibuis take note!) Also, if you're on the juicy/chunky side, or have a round jaw, avoid polo tees like the plague.
* The sleeves should end about midway on your biceps. Also, they shouldn't be too tight; lift your arms up in the fitting room. You shouldn't feel any constriction. (Unless you're really damn fit and can rock that muscleman style.)
* Length-wise, just tuck in, then raise your arms all the way up. If it doesn't pop out of your pants, it'll do. Unless you have washboard abs and don't mind flashing people.
* Of course, the tee shouldn't be so long that it can cover your butt la. Unless you're a skater, b-boy, rapper or something like that.
* Is the collar made from the same fabric as the rest of the tee? If yes, don't buy. It'll definitely warp and develop weird creases. The collar **has to** be made of a slightly ribbed stretchy material. I know this because I've made this mistake before.
* The skinnier you are, the bigger the design on the tee can be.

Onwards to **shirts**.

* ALWAYS try before you buy. They are less forgiving than tees, and tailoring isn't always a viable or wallet-friendly option.
* The longer and slimmer your neck, the higher your collar can go.
* Round-jawed dudes should try mandarin collars.
* Slim-cut for him isn't always slim-cut for you. Everyone is juicy in different spots, so the size/length/position of the darts for the slim-cut effect will result in varying levels of effectiveness.
* Of course, perform the tuck-in-and-lift-arm test. At a bare minimum, the shirt shouldn't pop out of your pants and you shouldn't feel any constriction when your arms are parallel with your shoulders.

Re: **Bottoms**

* Besides fitting you well around the belly and hips, you also need to look at the fit around your thighs. Unless you have nice legs, the rule of thumb is your thigh circumference + 5cm. It'll be just nice to outline your figure and provide adequate comfort. (It applies for the buibui bros as well; too much fabric will make you look super cui, even though it covers everything.)
* Shorts
   * Unless you're rocking a certain style, or have very nice/long/slim legs, the length should be around your kneecap, up to 0-5cm above your knee.
* Pants
   * Avoid pants with elastic cuffs like the plague. Unless you wear a lot of boots, and/or have nice legs. 🙃
   * There are a thousand and one cuttings. (Really a hell lot to learn.) So, focus on getting a couple of nice straight-cut pants first.
   * Full-length pants should end between the top of your ankle joint and the top of your heel bone. Just nice for a peek at your socks.
   * For other lengths, the rule of thumb is it should end where the slim-enough part of your calves start. HIGHLY personal as it depends on your leg shape; explore later.
   * Always try before you buy. They can be less forgiving than shorts.

## Part 4: Coordinating Outfits

Oh boy. This part is yet another area of study; which is why people pay stylists. So, a few easy tips.

* Take a photo of the mannequin in the shop when you buy the item. Just copy the shop assistant's homework!
* If the colours are next to each other on the rainbow, it'll work fine. For example, a dark forest green top will go with blue bottoms. Or a orange top with light brown bottoms.
* Stick to 2-3 main colours in an outfit. Yes, black and white are colours too. Black and white = 2 colours.
* Copy the designer's homework - if the colour exists on the tee/shirt, just wear more of it. (You can also vary the brightness and saturation.)
   * Example 1 - [https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444544-000?colorCode=COL00](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444544-000?colorCode=COL00)
A bottom in red, yellow, brown, or black will work. Apply the same logic to the rest of your outfit.
   * Example 2 - [https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444643-000?colorCode=COL64](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444643-000?colorCode=COL64)
Not at all a fan of this shirt. But you know what, it's a common enough piece that has cramped so many dudes' styles that I think it's worth discussing. So, the obvious answer is a pair of dark blue jeans, which looks SUPER dowdy. (Hell, even the model looks miserable in it.) Unbutton that top button and put on a pale blue pair of shorts instead, maybe in a super light jeans fabric. Then white sneakers, white bag, done. (Black, grey, green, or red works too.)
   * This logic applies to everything. Yes, even your weeb tee. Try a dark teal bottom with your Hatsune Miku tee, or a dark pink/dark red pair of shorts with your Anya Forger tee.

Of course, repeating this exercise for everything in your wardrobe will probably cause it to explode exponentially. This brings us to...

## Part 5: Wardrobe Curation & Shopping

Option 1: Remember the colour test in step 1? Look at your wardrobe first; the odds are good that you already have stuff that suits you. Streamline down to 1-2 colours that suit you (and make you happy to wear), and the neutrals that match it. (Keep the blacks, whites, and jeans too.) Then add whatever items contain the colours you picked. Then store/sell/donate everything else that doesn't match or suit you. Then go shopping if need be.

Option 2: Of course, if you absolutely hate your current style (or have a lot of budget), go hunt for a super unique patterned/printed shirt that looks REALLY GOOD on you. Then buy a printed tee that is a close sibling of that shirt. Then REALLY copy the designers' homework. Buy a top and a bottom for each colour found on the two tops. Then fill up with the basics.

At the end of the exercise, your wardrobe should have:

* 10 solid colour tops: A few tees and a few shirts, in black/white/neutral and the colours you chose.
* 1-2 patterned tops that match the above colours.
* 2-3 pairs of jeans - light blue, blue, dark blue, grey, black.
* 3 pairs of pants in neutral colours.
* 3+ pairs of shorts in jeans or neutral colours.
* 1-3 pairs of shorts/pants in your signature colour(s)
* 1 set of bags/shoes/accessories in the same neutral colour (some accents and slight variations are fine, but largely must be the same.)
   * If you have budget, get another set in your favourite colour or a colour that suits you. You can go crazy, because it's more forgiving. But do make sure the item sets are a close match in colour. Bonus points if the sets contrast well with what you own.
      * Example 1: You're cool-toned, and most of your wardrobe is various shades of blue and green. Get a pair of red sneakers, a red cap/watch, and a casual red sling bag. Done.
      * Example 2: You like blue colour, but you're warm-toned and dark-skinned, so your wardrobe is white, yellow, and brown. You can get bright blue accessories.
   * For reference: My husband's muted grey-blue set, and my sets. We have black sets too, but that's generic AF. [https://imgur.com/a/61Rf4ro](https://imgur.com/a/61Rf4ro)

List what you are missing, then go shopping. (Contrary to gender-based stereotypes, I do not believe in shopping without a checklist.)

Note: I did not include sports gear, jackets, home clothes, etc. as these are highly dependent on lifestyle. But, the most cost-effective and easy option is to get these in your neutral colour.

**Where to go:**

* Basics: Uniqlo. It is popular for good reason. If you have a bit more budget, go visit Zara, MUJI, Mango, or the outlet shops at IMM. Easties can go Changi City Point.
* Hiking outdoors: This is for weather-appropriate pants and shirts. Visit the big Decathlon outlets, or go to [Velocity@Novena](mailto:Velocity@Novena). If you have budget, try Timberland.
* Edgy style (and people who like ADLV tees): Pull & Bear. DOT Singapore.
* Shirts: Besides the shops listed under Basics, you can also try department stores. Plenty of good options, especially if you choose colours that feel younger or have boyishly-cute prints. (Things like tiny boats, tiny leaves, etc.)

IDK, anyone with more suggestions? Please comment; I'll compile and credit.

**EDIT: Community Contributions**

* [SunnySaigon](https://www.reddit.com/user/SunnySaigon/) \- H&M (Apparently, good quality and fitting basics. OP thinks that YMMV.)
* [paddy\_boomsticks](https://www.reddit.com/user/paddy_boomsticks/) \- For tall dudes: ""Tommy Hilfiger polos on Zalora are often discounted and also come in a longer cut.""

## Closing comments:

* If you're just trying out a new colour, start with an affordable top first. It requires less commitment than a bold colour bottom.
* Feel free to shop online, but do it with a current set of measurements and a clear understanding of what suits you.
* Find an affordable tailor. My tailor converted some of my Uniqlo tees into tanks; they look so much better on me now.
* u/se4nnnn wrote a [basic guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/inhie2/beginners_fashion_guide_for_males_singaporean/) 2 years ago too; feel free to read it too for the absolute basics. Here are a few points from there that I'd like to comment on.
   * The quality & cutting at ZARA & Mango can be quite inconsistent, but you will find some gems there.
   * Sports shoes are amazing for comfort, so please don't avoid them lol. IDK about y'all, but comfort is priority number 1. Coz there's nothing sadder than stylish-but-tired feet and faces on a nice day out. Consider investing in a really nice and stylish pair, and maintain them well.
   * Yeah, do avoid having too many complicated-looking tops. A couple of pieces will do. (5-10% of your wardrobe is fine.)
* As with many things, YMMV. If you wanna break some of the rules, coz it looks good to you or makes you feel good, go for it.
* This post is still an info dump, even though it's only a basic guide. I'll do a detailed series of guides if this post gets, idk, 2k upvotes? Or if I hit 200 follows? Some indication of interest, I guess.
   * Some of the topics that I didn't even mention here: Silhouettes for your shape (I can include a very helpful segment for moderately juicy people), Online shopping, Aesthetic styles, Matching the occasion, and Breaking the rules

   * Me:  Have ah. Just do Part 1. Then chuck out all the tops that don't suit your skin tone.
* u/knead4minutes:  imho the amount of recommended bottoms is total overkill
   * Me:  You are right, especially if you do laundry twice (or more) a week. Cut down the numbers if it makes sense for you.

Like lady wtf?? It's YOUR KID'S POOP you can't expect someone else to clean up after your mess?? She likened it to vomit, and then kept repeating it was harrassment and that she would get the cleaners to come afterwards. The entiltement is actually disgusting - YOU should clean up after yourself. Do you not feel ashamed?? 

Only regret is that I didn't make more of a fuss and take a video of her.

405,What do you as Singaporean think of fat acceptance in general?,"Hi,

I just had a conversation with my cousin yesterday and it got me thinking. I was consoling her after she got rejected by a guy. 

So my cousin used to be on the chubby side. Always shy and never had a boyfriend. Then she went to USA to study. There she went from chubby to obese. Think flabby arms roll down her elbow and cannot climb 1 flight of stairs that type. 

After she came back she gained more confidence. So she asked a colleague of hers to be her boyfriend. She showed me his picture and I think he was out of her league. So unsurprisingly he rejected her.

She called me to ask for my opinion. I told her to lose weight. She will look healthier and more beautiful if she lost some weight. That triggered her and she kept on talking while crying for 30 mins lol. 

She said 
1. American society is more advance than Singapore society because they are more tolerant of fat people. 
2. We should accept fat people and not force them to lose weight. 
3. Fat can be healthy and fat can be beautiful. 
4. We should have a fat movement in Singapore. 
5. We should not impose our thin culture to fat people. We should not ask people to lose weight. 

After that she hung up. Today she posted on her Instagram ""I am worth as much as I weigh"" and ""Will dedicate her entire life to promote fat culture in Singapore"". I showed that to my mom and laugh die us. Lol

But anyway do you really think we should have a fat culture or support fat movement in Singapore?

Wow this really blew up. Some updates if anyone is still interested

Edit 1 : I don't know the exact conversation between her and the guy but she did mention the guy rejected her because of her weight.

Edit 2 : Her mom (my mom's sis) said she has been crying the entire day. Maybe I will ask her to join the gym with me. If she refused then I don't really care.

Anyway thank you all. I posted this because she said Singapore should have fat acceptance culture aka fat = beautiful & fat can be healthy. I don't agree. So I just want to know what is the general sentiment of fat acceptance/fat culture.",veyail,1044,0.89,Opinion / Fluff Post,1655526514.0,532,cylim123,1199,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/veyail/what_do_you_as_singaporean_think_of_fat/,,False

Feel free to deviate from my points but i mostly brought them as how the left in general is portrayed to be.

Im also curious to find out if all the younger gen people are like that seeing how more or less im one myself, and I seldom find such discourse outside, relative to here at least.

488,Have anyone of you dealt with behaviors like this and how do you handle it ? I encountered it today in kopitiam and I was so shocked I lost all my assertive abilities because it was so out of my expectation of what I would define as rude that I had no immediate prepared action of respond.,"It was around evening time and I was just minding my own business eating.

&nbsp;

There are some people standing waiting for food to take away in front of the store in front of me.

&nbsp;

Then suddenly a hand came between me and my food and as soon as it came between he snapped his finger like one would call a waiter during the late 80's.

&nbsp;

I immediately looked up as he snapped up to avoid being hit by his fingers, naturally this directed my eyes towards his gaze.

&nbsp;

It was a guy around his late teens to early twenties.

&nbsp;

He said ""Is anyone sitting here ?"" as he put his hand on the chair in front of me.

&nbsp;

My blood was boiling...

&nbsp;

My mind started to go in three directions:

&nbsp;

Option 1:                         
If I shouted at him, I would have created a scene and people would not understand besides noticing a shouting man...it will not be to my advantage. 

&nbsp;

Option 2:                        
Should I say to him ""Do you think it is ok for you to do this ?"" ?     
And I distinctively remembered telling myself, if this person is capable of doing this, there is a 70% chance he has no respect for me or what he projected me to symbolize and a narcissist's worst respond would be when they are confronted with what they actually did wrong and I have to question whether it is my desire or duty to make this into a ""take a seat with me"" moment.

&nbsp;

Option 3:                        
His behavior is not for me to correct, take this mild abuse and let it go, I am not hurt in anyway, eat and go.

&nbsp;

These three thoughts happened in less then a second and I took option 3 and said ""no, this sit is not taken"".

&nbsp;

He pulled the chair away from the table...and when his food arrived, he stood up, took the food and walked off...leaving the chair in that awkward blocking position.

&nbsp;

Not knowing what is the proper respond because I have never encountered this level of behavior; I hope I can get some real life responses from some of you as to how you would handle it.

&nbsp;

However, today when I asked when could I fill up the form, he informed me that now all part timers and contractors could not take any leave, even unpaid one. Not to mention if we did not turn up for three consecutive days, we will be terminated even if you give prior notice and reasons why you cannot come. 

However, based on my contract, I am entitled to unpaid leave if it was for valid reasons. Not to mention I have yet to went pass three months into the contract where after three months I will be entitled to paid leaves, so if even unpaid leave cannot take, paid leave how ah.

543,Recruiters in SG - common to ghost candidates?,"[Secretlab] 

Hey all.

Slightly crestfallen here. Had my third and final interview with a company a week last Monday (2 weeks ago from today) and everything was going amazingly until then. The recruiter had been very communicative and positive and I almost felt like the job was mine. Was told the third interview was just to get 'confirmation that you're the right fit for the company and isn't going have have questions about the job itself' and the guy who interviewed me told me not to expect a reply that week. No worries. At the end of the week, on the Friday, I sent a WhatsApp (that's how the recruiter was writing to me) asking if he's any updates just ahead of the weekend, but no response. I see him online, but no reply. I patiently waited all of last week but nothing, so I sent another last Friday - again no reply and today also nothing.

572,"CPF Voluntary Contributions (expats, what are your thoughts?)","Fellow SG'reans and laojiao expats,

Living and working abroad means zero CPF savings/ contributions (literally close to 0) and I wondered what's the best way to think about CPF voluntary contributions (VC) especially given in the current macro environment.

High inflationary environment means you would avoid bonds while the high likelihood of recession drives me away from equities which makes CPF seem like a highly attractive place to park cash. Though this might lock up liquidity away to scoop up cheaper assets when a recession comes...

On VC, you can select to contribute to SA or Medisave (but not OA) and I realized the intentions need to be clear if these savings are for retirement or for future (potential) medical emergencies. Because contributing to your Medisave might earn the same interest (as SA) but will **never** get paid out (less for family/self medical needs) as it is still kept separate from the Retirement Account post retirement age. 

Pros of VC:

* (fairly) Risk-free rate at 4-5% (contributing into SA) 
* Technically still able to control investments choices via CPFIS 

Cons of VC:

* CPF saved locked up till retirement age (post that only a steam of income and not lump sum)
* Risk to policy changes (CPF interest rate or Retirement Age for withdrawal changes)
* No tax benefits for Expats :(

 It's hard to see the piles of new clothes overcrowding the old clothes in her closet. She bought so much that the closet have no more capacity for the remaining. 
Despite the full capacity, she continues shopping and would place clothes on a clothing rack, which was placed inside her room. When the rack collapsed under the bulky load of clothes, she didn't bat an eye. I told her to stop buying as the closet couldn't handle anymore. She refused, claiming that the clothes she bought is her money she earned from work. 

'It's my money, I can do whatever I want. Don't bother me,' she said. 

I didn't really want to bother her, rather to warn her about the clothing capacity and the money spent. I think she become a shopaholic. I couldn't persuade her as she turned a deaf ear. 

My dad noticed this long ago and endured it until he had enough. He scolded her that he will throw the clothes away and how she had gotten 'crazy'. After that, both didn't talked for a day. When he was leaving for work, he threw her clothes on the floor and leave the house.

My mom began to vent out her anger on me, cursing about my dad and how she owned this house with her money, not bothering my dad with money and yada yada yada. 
 
This same cycle went on again and again. I can't bear it everyday... I didn't want to deal with my parent's fights. I am sick and tired of being the middle man. I just want to be on my own somewhere.

593,Looking for Singaporean Music,"Hello everyone!

I am putting together a playlist/CD and I'm planning to include one song from every country (UN member) in the world. I'm here today to ask for some suggestions of music from Singapore.

For each country, I am looking for a song in the country's most prevalent non-English official language. So in this case, I would be looking for a song in **Mandarin**.

As I also want the playlist to be full of songs that I actually enjoy, I'd like to ask for suggestions of songs that are more high-energy, preferably from the relatively modern music scene. It doesn't have to be hardcore dubstep or anything, but I just prefer songs with faster tempos and a good beat that you can bop your head along with.

**Please note, I have a lot of countries to go through and so not a whole lot of time. Please only recommend *one or two songs*, and don't recommend an entire album or an artist's entire works. Just pick a really good one.**

615,Ninjavan breaking the law?,"Surely others have experience this as well.

You order stuff online and delivery will be made by ninjavan. When the item is delivered, they just throw   it in without checking if there is someone on the premise. Later on the day you receive email confirmation about the delivery and on the ""recipient signature"" section, there will be a single line made by the delivery person themselves.

Wouldn't this fall under fraud or identity theft? What's the point of having the signature section in the first place? Other deliveries like grab has the delivery confirmation done via photos of the item on premise. Not perfect, but at least we know that the item has reached the premise at some point.

 I'm not really looking to file a lawsuit or anything. Just wondering how the law works in singapore. Maybe there is a thing such as ""minor identity theft"" that is somehow ok? How is it that they've been allowed to do this for so long? I complained about this issue to ninjavan years ago and of course there is no reply.

625,There is certainly more than meets the eye about the Reema Razif vs SPF saga,"I will lay out some facts we know for sure from her posts, SPF's press release and also news articles. But it is in my opinion that her shenanigans act as a **huge setback** to general societal views about working childbearing mothers. It's a fact that the civil service is already extremely supportive of pregnancies, as compared to the private sector, which she does not seem to realise.

**Facts:**

* Reema has had 4 pregnancies in the past 5 years (from her facebook post)
* Reema alleged discriminatory practices due to her performance grade dropping from a B to C in 2019, which is 3 years after her first pregnancy (from her facebook post and [ST article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pregnant-officers-are-not-penalised-complaints-of-discrimination-looked-into-seriously-police))
* Reema made complaints about not getting a farewell card (or dinners, mementos or tokens) on her last day, and was quick to say that it's not about not getting gifts, but it's the "" realisation that you’re dispensable. "" (from her facebook post)
* Reema was given light duty assignments for the entirety of her pregnancies, and she has acknowledged that "" she would be taken off patrol duties and assigned office roles, such as manning the armoury counter. "" (From SPF press release and ST article)
* Reema also finds that her effort and hard work went ""unnoticed"" although she was working on the frontlines during covid-19 (ST article)
* Reema made a post in April 2020 saying that she was still "" hustling with no complaints "", and was still ""  trying to prevent/minimise crime, protecting the innocent, rendering assistance & advise, being exposed to unpredictable dangers, facing a widespread of personalities .  ""
* She joined SPF in 2011 as a corporal and was promoted once in 2015 to sergeant (ST article)
* She also questioned (herself) why "" many juniors were promoted so quickly. "" (ST article)
* (Added through an edit) The SPF confirms that ""The SPF does not penalise officers who are pregnant"" and this is corroborated through the fact that Reema's performance grade was not affected in the first TWO years of her pregnancies between 2017 and 2018 (she only complained about a drop in grade in 2019)

**What is unclear**

* Whether her supervisor said in verbatim ' cos you were pregnant what'  in response to why her performance grade dropped
* Whether or not she was made (or suggested) to do work during her maternity leave (She claims she was advised to “ take up some projects during your maternity leave ” while SPF maintains that she "" was not asked to work while she was on paid maternity leave. ""

**The discrepancies**

* Reema holds the view that the effort she has put in should warrant a B grade instead of a C grade and claims discriminatory practices due to that drop in grade.
   * How could she have claimed in her April 2020 post that she was still going around rendering assistance and advice while being exposed to unpredictable dangers when she has acknowledged that she was taken off patrol duties while she was pregnant? Does she have an inflated or inaccurate view on her perceived effort vs her actual effort?
* Her performance grade was not at all affected in the first two years of her pregnancies (2017 & 2018), she only complained about her grade dropping from B to C (which is the default average grade in civil service) in 2019.
   * It could very well be that her back to back pregnancies took a toll on her physical health that she was not able to keep up with the demands of a police officer. If anything, her superior had to justify the drop in grade on paper.
* Reema thinks that she did so much work and put in so much effort (no doubt it could be true that she tried her best), but her colleagues were not appreciative of it and she felt dispensable.
   * For **5 years**, her colleagues had to take up her share of patrols and extra desk work while she was on maternity leave for 1/3 of each year. How could she not have picked up on the fact that maybe her colleagues were getting burnt out because of the additional workload caused by her back to back pregnancies?
   * The fact that her colleagues did not bid her farewell tells us a lot about her relationship with her colleagues (and superiors), which brings me to the next point.
* It took her ~~5~~ *4 years (2011 -2015)* to get promoted from a corporal to a sergeant (a commenter suggested that this could be due to the change to a unified rank scheme, where the minimum entry rank is sergeant, which suggests that this promotion was not based on her performance) while she claims to wonder why her juniors were getting promoted quicker than her.
   * There are several possibilities:
      * There is a mismatch between her perception of her performance and actual performance
      * Her educational qualifications hampered her promotions
      * The relationship with her colleagues and superiors was not optimal",v8ui3q,961,0.93,Serious Discussion,1654819026.0,519,ZeroPauper,9665,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/v8ui3q/there_is_certainly_more_than_meets_the_eye_about/,,False

681,Exploring Singapore households and homes,"Met up with some friends recently, and they were talking about how you can know a lot about a Singaporean household just by taking a step into their homes (without the owners around). 

Some of the common things include 

\- If you see a musical instrument, you can probably guess that the family values arts, or at least tries to emphasise arts in their children's daily lives. 

\- If you see a bookshelf with various genres of books, you can probably guess the sort of eclectic interests in which these family members have. 

\- For food wise, you can look at things such as whether they have a tech-stye Smart refrigerator, or whether they invest in a great coffeemaker, or whether they have an island for baking or cooking. 

\- And on a more Singapore front, you can see if they have bicycles stored in their homes (on the local cycling hype!) , whether they have religious altars (mirroring the myriad of faiths practised here), whether they have branded goods (in line with how Singapore has a strong consumerist culture), and so on..

720,What are some of the common sales tactics property agents here have up their sleeve?,"Getting fed up with how property agents operate here in Singapore. I really feel like our CEA is only looking out for their own and has no interest in regulating how the agents work. 

Given now it is a seller market, some warning to new folks who are looking to rent or buy now.

\- New units on the market, generally agents are going to use you as a bait, meaning if you make an offer, they will use that as a floor price to negotiate with other buyers  
\- Phantom buyers, telling you another buyer has a better offer, and manipulating you to increase your offer  
\- Price fixing, they form teams and take up all similar type of units in the same building or they spam multiple listing of the same unit with different photos. To give an impression all the units here cost X amount. Example 326D Anchorvale Horizon and 472C Fernvale street (check it out now before it is removed)  
\- Open bidding war, have you and all the buyers in the same room and make them fight it out

In some cases, it's best to walk away or (make an offer you think is reasonable) and don't get baited.

I do know that there is Project ADORE across various shelters. I tried messaging Exclusively Mongrels a month ago via WhatsApp twice to enquire if there are any dogs available, but they didn’t reply so I guess the option of adopting from that shelter is out. I do know that there are other shelters too, but can someone shed some light on the process?

I do know that there will be interview and a 2-week homestay. How strict are the requirements and how detailed is the interview process? I also read that the Singapore Special dogs under Project ADORE should undergo training programs, is this a must? Is it better for me to go for a physical adoption drive? I’ve browsed adoption gallery for some dog shelters but most haven’t been updated or it shows just a few dogs.

744,An Unbuilt Singapore: The Never-Built Simpang New Town,"Looking at the new URA Long Term plan, it makes me satisfied to see the jungle (and SAF area) northeast of Khatib not being razed for a new HDB estate. However, there were plans dating from the 90s for a town to be developed in what would be called Simpang New Town. The town could have been built but plans were delayed indefinitely for some unknown reason, with the '97 Asian Financial Crisis being the most likely for the delay

&#x200B;

[Designed by IM Pei, source: https:\/\/www.archigardener.com\/2021\/03\/unbuilt-singapores.html](https://preview.redd.it/hu3fny2phy391.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8efaf3f82dcab57b4c8b3b7bc9aa8e305ea404)

The town would have special reclaimed islands, and looked rather ambitious in the concept plans of 1991 and 2001

&#x200B;

[The 1990 master plan](https://preview.redd.it/hculqwztiy391.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=84274af62a72cd7a70cfe2e3b6da8bd3f68dd690)

The plan of 2001 made the town look even greater, with Pulau Seletar being used for housing, an LRT passing through, from Canberra to Khatib, and an MRT line, presumably the North Coast Line, a planned line from Sembawang/Woodlands to Pasir Ris and Changi, eastern half is superseded by the Cross Island Line.

&#x200B;

[Even has its own MRT station and LRT system](https://preview.redd.it/j655xr19jy391.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7aa85d283b4e7b8538ead2b34d649be88bf4650)

The Simpang Planning Report of 1993 (accessible by going to URA's website on the Wayback Archive) showed that there are plans for ferries linking the town to Pulau Seletar. The plan was to have 20,000-27,000 dwelling units. This might sound ambitious for a period of time in the Ulu north where Admiralty and Sembawang are still under construction. The 1998 Master Plan (you can look up on nas.gov.sg/archivesonline) still shows a developed looking Simpang (without the MRT in the later concept plan) How would it look like if it was built? Try thinking of Sengkang, built around 2000-2010, with an LRT system.

The 2011 concept plan and the 2022 long term plan show that the area is a reserve site, which means plans are still being reviewed. With increasing environmental concerns in the 2022 plan, and since the area nearby is marked to be a ""nature corridor"", we could say, it could be a nature reserve.

&#x200B;

There were many more plans from the 90s that were never built, such as Jurong East ([URA Annual Report 1997/98 (page 15)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Resources/Publications/Annual-Reports/PDFs/AnnualReport_1997-1998.pdf)) and Woodlands ([with a proto RTS, i forgot where I got this image from, but I hope to find a higher quality one](https://i.imgur.com/T7Vna0Q.png)) regional centres, Outram Park being developed, Punggol 21 etc. It's possible to look at the development guide plan writeups by going to the URA website on Wayback, but most images are sadly gone.

763,How to deal with heel stomping and dog barking neighbours?,"Recently, my wife and I moved into a studio unit that we're currently renting in a condominium not too long ago (about a year ago)

We have this issue where the unit us above would let their dog(s?) bark after bedtime hours and the owners would stomp their heels as they walked around the house.

Initially we didn't do anything about it because we didn't want attract any attention, but lately the noises have gotten increasingly worse.

At first it was the occasional stomping and dog barking. Now, their dogs would bark for HOURS after 12am and the owners would be awake from midnight to early morning, constantly stomping through the night. I'm not sure if they're hefty-sized people or have issues walking but, the intensity of the vibrations can be felt and the sounds are able to pierce through ear plugs.

I've tried sending them a letter by slipping it into their house while they were awake at 4am and causing a nuisance.

I've tried contacting the police more than 10 times.

I've tried contacting the condominium management more than 10 times.

Nothing seemed to work, and if anything, it's gotten worse. I'm sure the neighbours around are troubled by the loud dog barking noises too, so I'm not sure how they can keep getting away with it.

The dogs and their barking can be heard as far as across the street's HDB block area.

My wife and I work 13 hour shifts (AM/PM) and it's been driving us crazy. We've had to go to work without proper sleep or any sleep at all so many times and it's affecting our health greatly.

Any advice would be appreciated, because I'm at my wits end.

765,Getting driving license in Singapore is getting ridiculous and laughably bad,"First to start it off, this is an ongoing problem for quite some time with the thread below:

[\-](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/rie8sy/fedup_with_the_process_of_getting_drivers_license/)\-Removed some old reddit links--

And   i thought it was just a typical complaint session from Singaporean   until i faced it first hand. And i would like to bring more attention to   this issue and hopefully you guys can realise how ridiculous the whole   situation is.

To start off, i   never thought of getting a driving license as i thought the public   transport is pretty good here and the price of car is ridiculous even   though my family always have a family car but throughout JC and Uni i   never once found the need to drive as i got steady friend who drive. Now   fast-forward to now, my parents are getting old, my workplace is at   another end of Singapore if i don't drive, my journey to office will be   1.25 - 1.5 hr. Fortunately i'm WFH now but my boss told my team that we   will be going back to office eventually and hence starts the journey  of  me getting my driving license.

Like   one of the TS from the above thread, i started in SSDC as a student,   only able to book 5 driving lesson which is 2 months later afterwards i   couldn't find anymore practical driving slot for the whole year (lol)   and my driving membership validity period is only for a year and writing   email to them is futile as they will just tell you to wait (I wish i   can do the same in my workplace).

Then   i went to BBDC and registered as private candidate and found my own   private driving instructor so at least i don't need to wait for   practical driving lesson slot in school. Then moving to the next phase,   LO AND BEHOLD, THE FABLED TP Simulator which was recently made   complusory by the TP before you can take your TP driving test. I need to   take 3 session, but BBDC only allows you to book 1 session at any one   time. So i must complete the first session before i can book the second   session. And guess what? I have to wait for 2 months (August) to get  the  first session. At the rate i'm going i will probably only get my   license after going back to office for a year.

Let me explain the absurdity to the whole of this shit show,

\-   Firstly the driving membership validity period is only for a year,   however every booking takes 1-2 month to book in advance. So you most   definitely cannot complete the prerequisite (Driving lessons/ TP   Simulator/ TP driving test) in time to get your driving license.

\-   Secondly, based on my experience in driving at the first school (ssdc)   as a student, the instructor will try their best to delay your  progress,  if you are learning too fast means you requires fewer class  hence less  money for the school

\-  Thirdly,  while registering i noticed that alot of foreign worker were  also  learning how to drive in these driving school so now the driving  school  is serving 2 huge group of people, the general public and  transport  workers. I would think that they would need a more  specialized school  due to the nature of their job and looking at our  road incident record..

\-  Lastly, i  noticed the people working in the driving school thinks it's  okay for  things to stay this way (Such incompetency and inefficiency  would  result in people getting fired in the real corporate world)  knowing  that they have a bottleneck, they don't take initiative or even  attempt  to solve it, they just thinks that the issue will resolve by  itself  (Just wait lor, wait it out, maybe next year less people apply  for  lesson). BBDC only got 4 simulator machine to be shared by both car  and  motorbike learner, and they don't seems to be adding more machine.

SO DON'T SAY I JUST COMPLAIN HOR, LET ME PROVIDE SOME SOLUTION.

1.)   Since driving school cannot handle the number of prospective driving   learner, i proposed the re-issuance of private driving instructor   license. Since the old batch like mostly dead or retired and the   remaining one are acting like king of the mountain, gaslighting student   to make them take more lesson. Injecting new blood will not only   revitatlize the driving teaching industry it will also flush the old and   incompetent one out.

2.)   Attempting to earn money from student by prolonging their stay in school  is plain dumb as it will only increase your current load and not  allowing you to bring in more new student. So school should be  incentized to help student get their license asap, let student pay a fix sum of money upfront like university then if they can get pass their license fast = you can get them out of the school quick hence more space for new student.

3.) Just set up another school for professional, simple as that.

4.)   TP need to admit TP simulator is actually unnecessary, i know of  people  who skipped this due to medical reason (not a small number) and  they  still get their license so in theory TP simulator is not  complusory.  Also instead of using simulator, perhaps do it like a  corporate training  module where people need to watch the video and  answer the questions at  the end of the video. So the bottle-neck from  the driving school will  be gone.

====================================================================================

Finally   people who are facing the same issue as me now, you can actually write a complaint or e-feedback to TP and hope that they take action on the  driving school. Since we student (customer) cannot compel them to   improve. Perhaps TP can save us.

&#x200B;

\--TLDR

Driving school in Singapore is terrible, and it would take at least 1/1.5 years to get your driving license now.",v5idpv,326,0.88,Serious Discussion,1654450770.0,161,BigKorKor,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/v5idpv/getting_driving_license_in_singapore_is_getting/,,False

769,Urgent help: Friends detained at JB because customs officers didn't stamp their passports,"Would really appreciate everyone's advice on what to do.

For context, I went with a group of friends on a short 3D2N trip to JB. Most of our friend group went on Friday morning by bus, but 2 friends rented a car and joined later that evening. These 2 friends cleared the Woodlands checkpoint but ran into some issues with their Touch n Go card at the JB checkpoint (it was their first time travelling into Malaysia by car). The officer held onto their passports and directed them to sort it out at some kind of toll office, and when they finished up and came back, they didn't check whether their passports were stamped. While they obviously should have checked, I believe that this genuinely slipped their mind amidst the chaos and confusion.

Earlier today we were returning to SG in the same rented car. The officers noticed that 2 passports lacked a stamp and took us for questioning. Imo, they were very hostile and intimidating -  for example one of them would walk over to a wooden board where they had printed out and pinned the relevant statute stipulating the maximum penalties etc, and made a big show of reading it. They also pulled one of us (who was a Malaysian aside) and kept communicating in Malay while not really explaining the situation to the rest of us, and repeatedly emphasized the gravity of the offence, the 14 day maximum detention period etc. They seemed very insistent on detaining my friends, even though my friends tried very hard to explain their case and even offered proof of entry via the causeway on their driver's app etc.

So currently, my 2 friends are being detained there and are uncontactable. The rest of us headed back to SG via bus and have notified their family and friends. We've tried calling a few lines eg the High Commission but this all happened after office hours so we couldn't get a hold of most of them.

I'm worried sick for my friends especially as I'm unfamiliar with the conditions of the detention center and how they're being treated. Would really appreciate advice/sharings by anyone who's encountered similar situations.

792,Failed to find a job in the US,"I always wanted to work in the US for a few years because I think my career is at a bottleneck. I'm not getting as much promotions or work opportunities as the foreigners I know (I won't call them expats because they are Asians who worked in HK or somewhere for a while and then came to Singapore) or locals who are lucky enough to be sent overseas to other countries, and I think it's because my resume does not show international experience. I'm in my late 20s, in the financial services sector. My past jobs are not very technical but I guess makes use of critical thinking, stakeholder communication and other soft skills. My past companies are F500 and public service.

I know that Singapore has a special category of job visa in the US that's why I wanted to work in the US. Previously I tried Japan because I have JLPT N2 proficiency but idk if it's because of sexism, the companies rather chose men who doesn't speak Japanese (I guess it's not an advantage even if I know the language), so I gave up on Japan. I then spent my life savings to study a Master's degree. I didn't find a job in 1 year and now I have to go back to Singapore, and have to take pay cut because Singapore HR says ""I am not up to date with local economy"". 

Is it really impossible to work overseas?

Basically, I'm wondering what gyms have routes for my grade level.I looked at all the gyms and was considering boulder+ Chevrons since it was a large gym  (I already googled all the gyms but of course, no way to tell what grades they set).

Also are there any gyms with a both a moon and kilter board?

&#x200B;

\*Update: BoulderWorld is perfect! They have a kilter, moon, and tension board, as well as some pretty hard routes.

883,Happy Pride Month to all LGBT+ Singaporeans!! :-),"Hello! Out here to wish all of my fellow LGBT+ Singaporeans a happy Pride month (tbf I wanna celebrate us all *EVERY* month, every day, every minute because we **deserve it** but then it'd get a bit too repetitive!)

To clarify to any non-queer people who aren't allies on the subreddit what Pride exactly means or it's origins, Pride month is celebrated in June as a commemoration to Stonewall, which took place in June 1969, indicating our resistance and resilience to how states and society are **violent** towards queer people. While this has roots in the United States, Pride is now celebrated worldwide, especially in Singapore with events like Pink Dot and a *whole host* of community gatherings, celebrations, and events.

Pride month, in my view, is two things that are *overlapping*. It's meant to celebrate each other for who we are, the love we share, without judgement or ridicule, knowing that, in the structures of society we live in, queer people are traditionally marginalized, which is to say that they don't have the same level of power or freedom to live their lives, and if they do, it's *in spite of* the state and society they live in. Basically, **Pride month is showing resistance to power that is violent towards queer people by celebrating, appreciating, lifting up, and loving who we are.**

This hits close to home, especially to people like me (a pansexual pal who's just realized they're non-binary AND a relationship anarchist). There may be some rumblings that 377A *could* be repealed, thanks to a speech by Shanmugam and that one REACH survey, but even if it does, queer discrimination, especially material privilege, is **more than 377A.** Heckin' Unicorn has a [great post here](https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/the-price-of-being-queer-in-singapore-lgbt-rights-in-singapore#grand-summary), but here's a few notable ones. 

We are still denied public housing until later in life as queer couples/family units can't get married/have a civil union, which prices out many queer people in finding safe, queer-friendly housing unless we rent (*which ain't too cheap in SG, and landlords can still kick queer people out*) or fork out tonnes of money (*which only those with existing privilege can realistically afford*) to buy a private place. For trans people, healthcare costs get seriously high for gender-affirming healthcare which trans people have to pay the brunt for, which also affects their own health if they *are not able* to receive such care that they need. Even for adoption rights, Singapore literally took the effort **this year** to close a legal loophole that previously allowed queer couples to adopt children. Not to mention that 'conversion therapy', a hokey, dangerous practice that people impose onto queer people to dispel the gay/trans out of them, is **not outlawed** in Singapore.

Repeal or not, queer people will always be seen by state power to be *unfit to exist* in this nation, which is why Pride is SO IMPORTANT, because we *celebrate* who we are, how much we love and care for ourselves in this nation, to show that yes, we **do exist**, and we fucking love ourselves, because we are different, because we're diverse, and because we're **Q U E E R**.

There are many things going on this month, but the biggest thing is that, yes, **Pink Dot** is back to being an in-person event!! It will be held at Hong Lim Park on **June 18th, 3-7 p.m.** I will admit that, yes, Pink Dot isn't great at sharing space/power with diverse groups of queer folk (cos yes, racism does exist, and cis-gay people *can* be excluding of other queer people, especially trans/nb folk), but I still recommend going as I personally find gathering physically is the *best way* to find community in a state that discourages the formation of such communities. There are other events too (I believe PinkFest.sg has TONNES), but honestly celebrate in the best way for **you**. Whether that's physically gathering at a large event, going out for a private thing, meeting up with online pals, having a small party with fellow queer people you know, or even just celebrating **yourself**, Pride month is the time to celebrate yourself for being queer, and that's fucking awesome.",v26gkk,587,0.75,Discussion,1654050248.0,106,TheStateOfIt,57827,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/v26gkk/happy_pride_month_to_all_lgbt_singaporeans/,,False
