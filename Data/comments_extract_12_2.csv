> SINGAPORE - Sexual health and challenges faced by the transgender community do not usually come to mind when people think of the medical profession, but they are among important issues Dr Ching Ann Hui and Dr Yuki Ong hope to spotlight.

> In 2019, they started health podcast Third Spacing, which takes its name from the medical term for the movement of fluid between cells and vessels.

> The series has since racked up nearly 50 episodes covering such topics, and features doctors who have taken unconventional career paths such as going from running a private practice in Singapore to working in Afghanistan.

> Dr Ching, 25, wants to improve marginalised populations' access to healthcare.

> ""As doctors, our work is focused on the body, and some of these topics will inevitably be messy. We have to be very cognisant of where our audience comes from, what their background is, and we work from there (to approach these issues),"" she added.

> She is one of more than 280 undergraduates from the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine who received their bachelor's degrees on Sunday (July 17).

> Some 500 students from the school were also conferred graduate degrees that day, bringing NUS' 28 commencement ceremonies this year to a close. They include medical practitioners, biomedical scientists and healthcare administrators.

> Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, an alumnus, said doctors should continually thirst for knowledge, explore new frontiers and stay true to the profession's values.

> ""Covid-19 was the crisis of your generation, but it will not be the last pandemic. Disease X will demand young people like you to be daring, imaginative and to pioneer breakthroughs in your respective fields,"" said Dr Tan, who was guest of honour at the postgraduate ceremony.

> New healthcare innovations and technologies were developed at an unprecedented pace during the pandemic, he said, adding that researchers around the globe raced against time to work on Covid-19 vaccines and artificial intelligence was harnessed to develop predictive technologies that saved numerous lives.

> Dr Tan reminded doctors about the importance of having strong principles.

> ""It may be tempting to fall back into the chase of the usual brass rings that society typically exhorts us to covet - fancy titles, bigger corner offices, more material possessions. This road may work for some, but it will come at huge costs and sacrifice, and it may also distract you from what is most important.

> ""Once you strip away the technological developments, healthcare is fundamentally a mortal enterprise. When you have a patient entrust their life to you, or when you see the labour of your work benefit countless others, then you will realise when medicine really becomes a fulfilling calling,"" he added.

igiep98,w16ebx,2vx2xcyw,"> # Shooting: Singapore's Teh Xiu Hong and Co create World Cup history in Changwon

> SINGAPORE - The Republic's shooter Teh Xiu Hong was so on fire that she scored a hit 15 times in a row towards the end of the ISSF World Cup women's 25m pistol medal match to win gold with a round of five shots to spare on Saturday (July 16).

> A hit is considered a shot value of 10.2 or higher.

> In doing so, the 28-year-old also helped Singapore win their first gold medal in the pistol discipline of the World Cup series, as teammate Teo Shun Xie took bronze in the same event.

> There were more reasons for the national shooters to cheer at the Changwon International Shooting Range on Sunday as Teh teamed up with her younger sister Teh Xiu Yi and Teo to beat Thailand's Tanyaporn Prucksakorn, Pim-On Klaisuban and Chawisa Paduka 17-9 to claim another gold in the women's 25m pistol team event.

> The trio had won another bronze in the women's air pistol team event on Tuesday after beating Japan's Yukari Konishi, Mika Zaitsu and Satoko Yamada 16-10 in the play-offs.

> In the individual event, Xiu Hong and Teo had made it to the last eight as the first and seventh qualifiers respectively out of 28 athletes.

> They were in separate ranking matches, where Xiu Hong recorded 14 hits out of 20 shots to edge Austria's Sylvia Steiner out of the medal match by one hit. Meanwhile, Teo topped her ranking match with 15 hits.In the four-woman medal match, the shooter with the lowest score after four rounds is knocked out, following which there will be further eliminations after two rounds until the champion is determined.

> India's Manu Bhaker was the first to fall after recording just nine hits in the first 20 shots. Xiu Hong led after six rounds with 23 hits but Frenchwoman Mathilde Lamolle and Teo were tied at 19 hits and required a shootout to decide who would progress. They drew 3-3 in the first shootout round, before Lamolle won 4-3.

> However, Xiu Hong was just too accurate and another perfect round meant that she led 28-21 and had an unassailable lead going into the final round.

> Singapore Shooting Association president Michael Vaz hailed the shooters' achievements despite not having a finals range and a similar competitive environment to train in at home.

> Congratulating the team, he also praised the champion, noted her growth and said: ""In 2018, I watched Xiu Hong enter the finals in the World Cup in Changwon, but the fear of shooting in a finals range terrified her. The lack of training in finals events saw her eliminated in the first round.

> ""Much has changed. In January 2022, I watched her struggle during the ISSF Jakarta GP to win a bronze. And Xiu Hong is now a World Cup champion, while Shun Xie also fought her way to a bronze medal, both of which are truly commendable achievements.""

> SINGAPORE - An appeal to donate blood as supplies run low has drawn an overwhelming response, with more than 3,300 people coming forward over the past week.

> This represents a 43 per cent increase from a typical week's collection, said the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), which is the Republic's national blood donor recruiter.

> ""We hope that this momentum will continue next week to bring our blood stocks up to healthy levels,"" said the humanitarian organisation.

> Located at the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) building in Outram Road, the Bloodbank@HSA - one of four blood banks across the island - was packed when The Straits Times visited on Friday (July 15).

> Among the donors there was Mr Goh Chee Wee, who said it was his first time donating since 1996.

> Work and other commitments, which often require him to travel, left little time for him to donate blood in the years since then, said the 43-year-old army regular.

> He was there with about 40 others from his unit, which had made an informal request for servicemen to volunteer to donate blood that day.

> Mr Goh, whose blood type is A+, said he was inspired by recent social media posts put out by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who shared SRC's call for blood donors to come forward.

> He added that as a sergeant major, he felt it was important to lead by example.

> Full-time national serviceman Eldridge Surianto was a first-time blood donor.

> The 19-year-old, who has O+ blood, said his decision to donate blood was a personal one - he has relatives who required blood transfusions because of cancer treatments.

> ""I was quite nervous at first,"" he said, noting that he had heard that giving blood could cause dizziness.

> ""But after this experience, I don't think it's that scary,"" said Mr Surianto, adding that he would consider doing it again in future.

> On July 8, SRC had called for more blood donors, said a spokesman, as there was less than nine days' worth of A+ and O+ blood then.
