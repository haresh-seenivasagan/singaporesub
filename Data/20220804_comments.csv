> SINGAPORE: It took Mr Jay Tun almost two years of deliberation before he bought his first luxury watch in 2018.

> The S$16,480 Rolex Sea-Dweller, which is still in his possession, started him on a journey that has been “hard to stop”.

> The 35-year-old has since spent more than S$300,000 on these timepieces. He now sees his watches, now valued at about S$400,000, as not just a passion, but also an investment.

> “I don't just like watches for the value. I like the watches for the different movements, different intricacies of the movements itself. It’s very intriguing … It’s like art to me,"" he explained.

> “Whichever purchase I want to buy, especially for watches, the numbers must make sense first. But of course the piece must be something that I like.”

> For luxury watches like some of the ones Mr Tun collects, demand far outstrips the supply. Watches from brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet are among the most popular.

> Buyers cannot just walk into shops and purchase these watches. There are usually long waiting or interest lists, especially for popular models, watch dealers and collectors said.

> Mr Jarod Ng, co-founder of retailer Watch Capital which sells new and pre-owned luxury watches, said a lot of people find the waiting time too long.

> “Let's just say that you want to buy this as a wedding anniversary gift or you want to buy it for your son as a graduation present. You can’t be waiting for two years when he graduates in the next six months,” said Mr Ng.

> Getting your name on the list also by no means guarantees you a watch.

> “With the authorised dealer, I think a lot of people feel the same frustration as I did. You go there and they will give you the standard SOP (standard operating procedure) - that this is a highly sought-after piece, there’s this interest list,” said Mr Tun.

> “If you don't follow up, if you don't buy anything more from them, likely you will never hear from them ever after.”

> Even VIP customers have to wait a few months for a watch of their choice, said Mr Tan Khai Hsiang, who runs an online shop on Carousell called KHF Watch.

> Mr Tan started out as a watch collector himself, and started buying and trading luxury timepieces on the e-commerce marketplace in 2019. He also purchases watches overseas on behalf of other dealers in Singapore.

> GOING FOR GREY

> New customers are often told that the watches they want are out of stock and so they turn to the grey market, Mr Tan said. The grey market is made up of retailers who are not officially authorised by brands to sell their watches.

> Mr Tan likened the process to buying an exclusive bag like the Hermes Birkin. “For normal people, it’s impossible to get,"" he said.

> Mr Charles Lee, founder of Good Time Luxury at Far East Plaza, said that it became harder to get watches amid the pandemic as customers could not travel overseas to buy them.

> “Even if they walk into the boutiques, you can’t get the popular models. You can’t get the Rolexes, the shelves are empty. That’s why people have to buy from grey dealers like us.”

> And some customers do not mind paying more to get what they want immediately.

> More popular brands and models can cost between 20 and 30 per cent more on the grey market, while some can command almost double the retail price.

> Checks by CNA on authorised dealer websites found that an entry-level Rolex Submariner model is listed for about S$12,000. On Chrono24, an online marketplace for watch buyers and sellers, the same model costs about S$22,000.

> SINGAPORE - It was meant to be a celebratory meal after the Neustadter Laufermeeting in Germany on Friday (Aug 5) but Singapore runner Goh Chui Ling's dinner was literally as flat as a pizza.

> The base of the seafood pizza for her dinner with friends was not salty enough, the tomato sauce was of low quality and the seafood tasted a bit sour.

> Fortunately for Goh, that was the only low point of an otherwise happy day for her as she broke her fourth national record this year - this time in the 3,000m.

> The 29-year-old clocked 9min 51.16sec in Neustadt an de Waldnaab, a small town in the south-east of Germany, to break K. Jayamani's 40-year-old record of 9:56.6 set in 1982.

> The record is pending ratification by Singapore Athletics.

> It was the first time Goh was racing in the 3,000m - a distance which is no longer on the programme at the Olympics and World Championships - and she was using it as preparation for the Aug 20 2.4km Pocari Sweat Run Singapore.

> She told The Straits Times: ""I knew that it would not come easy, it was not going to be something I could stride through and still get the record.

> ""I knew if I put in the work, I would get it. When I finished and saw my time, I was happy because it was my first-ever 3,000m. Hopefully in time to come, when I get to race more, I can lower it further.""

> This is now the seventh national mark that Goh holds, including two relays.

> Her good form started last October, when she broke the national best in the 10,000m (road) before rewriting her own mark just five weeks later.

> She then broke the 2.4km national best at the Pocari Sweat Run in January and set a new 5,000m (road) mark a month before the May SEA Games.

> She clinched two medals in the 1,500m and 10,000m at the SEA Games in Hanoi, while settling for fourth in the 800m.

> Last month, she rewrote another Jayamani record, the 40-year-old 1,500m national mark. With her latest record, Goh's momentum seems to be continuing its upward trajectory.

> Of her achievements, the lawyer, who is pursuing a PhD in international sports law and governance and is in Zurich as part of an exchange programme, said: ""It means boundaries can be broken. I'm starting to see that - of course there are limitations to training when it's hot and humid - but we can push limits to our bodies.

> ""To me, it's about knowing that I can break boundaries, and so can other Singaporeans in these distances.""

ij61c7f,whjhzy,n9wj4,"Same thing can be asked, why can't school start later? Waking up at 5-6am isn't exactly healthy om the developing mind.

I remember a dad mentioned about what he thinks is the reason why his kids don't want to sleep early- School already takes up like half of their day, which means that if they sleep early, that's more ""lost time"" to the remaimder of the day they have. So they compensate the lost time by sleeping later",2022-08-06 17:38:18+08:00,37,False
ij65e9u,whjhzy,56yhqpnn,"Later start times for schools is the obvious solution, but it’s still logistically tough currently. 

A lot of secondary schools already have some “late start” days every week, but on those days you can still see many students in school at the “normal” time because that’s the time their parents can afford to send them to school. With the emergence of post-covid flexible work arrangements this can be better mitigated. 

But starting late also means ending late. There are a certain number of academic periods required by MOE and these are pretty set in stone for most schools. The one extra hour in the morning has to be made up elsewhere. We can 1) cut syllabus to reduce teaching periods required, or 2) cut number of required subjects, or 3) cut other non-academic activities. 3 seems most likely currently and is probably also the one that will get the most public support.",2022-08-06 18:35:21+08:00,17,False
