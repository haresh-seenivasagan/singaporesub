> SINGAPORE: As a hydraulic engineer, Mr Chia Way Seng has worked quietly behind the scenes over the past two decades to find solutions to protect Singapore’s coast against rising sea levels.

> But he never expected his efforts to land him a knighthood one day.

> On Apr 27, the director of reclamation at Surbana Jurong’s coastal engineering team was conferred the Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau by Dutch royalty, making him among 3,500 recipients globally to receive the honour.

> Recalling the day he was knighted, Mr Chia said the entire event had been a surprise.

> “My nominator actually convinced me into thinking that I was attending a seminar, where he would be delivering a keynote address,” he said, adding that his bosses and colleagues were all aware that he would receive the award.

> It was only when the Dutch ambassador to Singapore announced that the knighthood would be awarded to an engineer and called out his name, that he realised what was going on.

> “(To be conferred) a knighthood was the furthest thing from my mind, I thought it would just be a letter of appreciation,” he said. “I felt very honoured to be able to go up to the stage and get the medal pinned on me.”

> SINGAPORE - Posted prices for 92-octane petrol have eased closer to the $3 mark as at Thursday evening (July 7), with price cuts of between 12 cents and 29 cents a litre across the five brands.

> According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by the Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso, Shell, Sinopec and SPC have adjusted prices since Wednesday.

> Sinopec, which has the smallest network of stations in Singapore, slashed the price of its premium 98-octane petrol by 29 cents a litre.

> Its 98-octane fuel, which is the next highest grade, is down 16 cents a litre. Both grades are now priced at $3.62 a litre.

> Shell was the next biggest mover, lowering prices by 20 cents a litre across its range of petrol.

> With the latest round of revisions, it costs $3.15 a litre for Shell's 95-octane petrol and $3.64 a litre for both its 98- and premium 98-octane fuels.

> SPC reduced prices by 16 cents a litre across all three grades of petrol it offers.

> Its posted petrol prices are now $3.10, $3.14 and $3.62 a litre for the 92-, 95- and 98-octane fuels.

> Esso's posted prices match SPC's for the 92- and 98-octane petrol. But at $3.15 a litre, its 95-octane petrol is a pricier.

> Caltex priced its petrol at $3.11, $3.19 and $3.83 per litre for the 92-, 95- and premium 98-octane fuels.

> Diesel prices are more closely aligned with just 2 cents a litre separating the most expensive (Caltex and Shell at $3.02 a litre) and the cheapest (Sinopec and SPC at $3 a litre).

> MPs had raised the issue of surging crude oil prices and the impact on drivers several times in recent Parliament sittings.

> On Tuesday, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said the Government will not regulate or cap pump prices as doing so distorts the market.

> But she added: ""The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore monitors the fuel market closely and will not hesitate to investigate the practices of the retail operators.

> ""We will take firm enforcement actions against any anti-competitive behaviour.""

> While he is glad pump prices are down, Mr Gordon Tiang, 47, from the telecommunications industry, said they are still high.

> ""It is good that prices are coming down. But the drop does not feel very significant.

> ""It still costs too much to fill up my car,"" said Mr Tiang, who pays more than $100 each time he fills up his 1.6-litre family sedan with 95-octane petrol.

> Under the pilot programme, ExxonMobil is providing sustainable aviation fuel for Singapore Airlines and Scoot flights from Changi Airport from July this year.

> The oil major was selected in February as the fuel supplier for the pilot programme launched by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Singapore Airlines and Temasek.

> The sustainable fuel is manufactured by blending ExxonMobil-produced refined jet fuel with the Neste-produced neat sustainable aviation fuel at ExxonMobil facilities. The fuel is then delivered to Changi Airport’s fuel hydrant system.

> ""ExxonMobil is bringing its established capabilities in fuels manufacturing and logistics to help customers such as SIA achieve their net-zero ambitions,"" said chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific, Geraldine Chin.

> ExxonMobil plans to provide more than 40,000 barrels per day of lower-emission fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, by 2025, and to further supply 200,000 barrels per day by 2030.

> Demand for lower-emission fuels is expected to grow amid decarbonisation efforts in transportation sectors, including aviation, marine and heavy-duty trucking.

> SINGAPORE - The two toddlers who were alone at home when a fire broke out in a Housing Board flat in Marsiling last month have been referred to Child Protective Service (CPS), said the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) on Wednesday night (July 6).

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, an MSF spokesman said CPS is investigating the case and is looking into whether the family requires additional support.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post last month that it was alerted to the fire at Block 218 Marsiling Crescent on June 22 at around 10.40pm.

> The fire, which involved contents of a bedroom, caused the entire unit to be affected by heat and smoke damage.

> Two police officers rescued the two toddlers, who were found conscious in the living room, before SCDF arrived.

> The toddlers' parents declined to comment, but told ST two days after the fire that their children were recovering well.

> Lawyer Ivan Cheong, a family law specialist at Withers KhattarWong, said CPS is involved when there are allegations of child abuse or suspicion that a child's welfare is not being adequately protected or looked after by his parents.

> ""CPS then steps in to interview the relevant caregivers, assess the situation and make recommendations to the court. A safety intervention plan could also be put in place pending the outcome of the investigation,"" explained Mr Cheong.

> He noted that such investigations can take a few weeks to a few months and the children may not necessarily live apart from parents during this period.

> After investigations have been completed, CPS may apply to the court for the relevant orders, which may result in the children being removed from the care of their parents, said Mr Cheong.

> ""They may be placed in the care of other competent caregivers until the children's safety and welfare can be assured,"" he added.

> SINGAPORE - A construction worker died in a forklift accident on Thursday (July 7) at a Build-To-Order (BTO) project site in Choa Chu Kang, taking the total number of workplace deaths here this year to 29.

> It is the third fatal workplace accident to occur at a BTO project site since the start of the year, the fourth involving a forklift, and takes place as workplace safety issues have come under close scrutiny in recent months.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the accident occurred at Keat Hong Link, where the upcoming 571-unit Keat Hong Verge BTO project is located.

> The worker, a 35-year-old Indian national, was standing on the rear counterweight of a forklift at the worksite while tying an electrical cable onto the side of an overhead beam when the forklift moved backwards suddenly.

> This occurred at about 10am, and the worker, employed by Mega Engineering (Singapore), was caught between the forklift's canopy and the beam.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for assistance at about 10.15am. The worker was unconscious when he was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

> A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested for a negligent act causing death, police said. The Straits Times understands that the man is a colleague of the dead worker.

> Teambuild Engineering and Construction, the main contractor and occupier of the worksite, has been ordered to stop all work there.

> ""As a general safety measure, forklifts should only be used for (their) intended purposes,"" MOM said, adding that investigations are ongoing.

> Keat Hong Verge is a Housing Board (HDB) development comprising three blocks of two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats. It is expected to be completed this quarter, and be ready for owners to move in by the first quarter of next year.

> According to its website, Teambuild is also the main contractor for at least four other BTO projects, including Northshore Edge in Punggol, Yishun Glen, and the recently launched Grove Spring @ Yishun.

> In response to queries, the firm said only that the authorities are still investigating Thursday's accident. HDB said it will work with Teambuild to assist with the probe.

> ""Safety is of utmost importance to HDB,"" said an HDB spokesman. ""We also extend our heartfelt condolences to the deceased's family and, together with the contractor, we will render support and assistance to them.""

> All three cases are not linked.

> Monkeypox is a viral disease that is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is typically a self-limiting illness where patients recover within two to four weeks.

> ""A small percentage of those infected can fall seriously ill or even die. Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals,"" said the ministry previously.

> SINGAPORE - The traditional norm of men marrying a wife who is less educated than them and women looking for a better-educated husband is changing.

> The proportion of men with wives who have less education than them fell from 16.3 per cent of marriages in 2011 to 12.3 per cent last year.

> Meanwhile, the share of marriages involving a woman who is better educated than her husband increased from 17.5 per cent of all marriages in 2011 to 18.2 per cent last year.

> The data was contained in the Statistics on Marriages and Divorces 2021 and published by the Department of Statistics (DOS). It was released on Wednesday (July 6).

> However, the majority of marriages involve couples with similar educational levels. Some 69.5 per cent of couples who wed last year fell into this category, up from 66.2 per cent in 2011.

> The increase in such couples is due to the higher share of civil marriages where both partners are university graduates and Muslim marriages where both husband and wife have post-secondary or university qualifications, the DOS said.

> The National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser described the trend of fewer men marrying less-educated wives and vice-versa for the women as socially significant.

> But he noted that educational qualifications may not necessarily be a good indicator of income and that income is still a key concern while selecting partners.

> Ms Shailey Hingorani, head of research and advocacy at the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), noted that traditional gender roles dictate that higher education increases one's job prospects, making the man more attractive as a husband who can fulfil the breadwinner role, while it decreases the chances of a woman staying home and depending on her husband to provide for the family.

> But there are now more female tertiary graduates, compared to men, and this has led to more men marrying someone with similar educational levels and fewer men with a less educated wife, said Dr Tan Poh Lin, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at NUS.

> Fei Yue Community Services social worker Marie Yeo said as more women are highly educated these days, they are financially independent and may not have qualms about marrying a less educated man.

> She has also seen a shift in expectations of the roles and responsibilities between the couple, adding: ""Women today value and expect men's equal contribution at home, and we are glad to see more men willing to take up their share of domestic responsibilities such as household chores, marketing and caregiving, while women also work and contribute financially to the home.""

> I read with some concern the report, ""Govt careful with disclosing racial data of prison inmates, criminals as minorities are over-represented: Shanmugam"" (July 4).

> While ostensibly serving a laudable objective, I fear that publicly acknowledging that selective disclosure is being done may paradoxically feed the very prejudices it was meant to pre-empt, by reinforcing the perception that minority races are frail and require extraordinary protection to conceal their shortcomings.

> Such disparities in social outcomes should be viewed as a society-wide issue deserving of national attention and resources, rather than mere triggers for intra-community ""self-help"" efforts, a posture that reinforces culpability as much as it does responsibility.

> From this perspective, disparities should not only be prominently highlighted, but also have their root causes deeply dissected.

> Is the minority over-representation influenced by the confounding variable of socio-economic disadvantage, which is then the real problem to get at?

> And if minority over-representation persists even after correcting for standard socio-economic parameters, could the problem be a structural one that disadvantages minorities, such as smaller networks and lower social capital?

> These are empirical questions that deserve careful scholarship, with wide-ranging implications for effective policymaking, an effort arguably best served by generous data transparency and vigorous public engagement.

> A policy of arbitrary data suppression, no matter how well-intentioned, may not mitigate stereotypes; worse still, it could entrench them more deeply.

Psychiatrist visits are usually quite brief. If you require help on certain aspect/ therapy, e.g. social skills, managing stress/ anxiety/ depression, behavorial management, etc, then you will need to see a psychologist.

I am not too sure about adult ADHD psychiatrist consult, I can only share about my children's experience. For my children with ADHD & under medication, consultation at Child Guidance Clinic (under IMH) is about $45 and timing can range from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on whether my children have any concern to be shared with the psychiatrist. So far I have quite good experience, the psychiatrist always take down notes on everything my children said or shared. The only drawback is the waiting time, usually can only book for appointment 4 to 6 months apart. However, my kids are now stable with their medication, so switching from private to subsidised route is more for long term affordable maintenance in our case.

Through the Child Guidance Clinic, I managed to get referral from the psychiatrist for my children for behavorial therapy via psychologist, occupational therapy, group therapy for social skills, all at affordable prices.

> SINGAPORE - Though they have pushed on with the business by selling chicken from other countries, poultry sellers in Singapore are still eager for the Malaysian chicken export ban to end.

> Most poultry sellers at four markets The Straits Times visited on Thursday (July 7) said that they are looking forward to Malaysia lifting the export ban on commercial broiler chicken as there is still demand from their customers for the product. Malaysia partially lifted the ban last month, allowing exports of kampung chicken and black chicken.

> Some wet market poultry sellers have experienced a dip in business even after they pivoted to kampung or frozen chicken. This is despite recent efforts to diversify Singapore's chicken supply, such as increasing imports from Thailand and the impending imports from Indonesia.

> Mr Abdul Rahman, 62, owner of Fresh & Frozen Meat Supplier at Rivervale Plaza, said sales have dropped by about 30 per cent since the ban, as customers still prefer chicken from Malaysia.

> He said: ""Now, we are selling frozen chicken from Brazil. We don't have any other chicken to sell. Some customers don't like the frozen chicken, and they still ask for the fresh chicken.""

> Over at Geylang Serai Market, Mr Hashim Abbas, 73, owner of Hashim Abbas Supplier of Fresh & Frozen Chicken & Meat, said he now sells frozen chicken from Brazil and Thailand and kampung chicken from Malaysia.

> Overall, prices at his stall have increased by about 50 cents per kg of chicken and this has led to a drop of 50 per cent in sales.

> Madam Roslina Onm, 55, owner of Jaafar Fresh and Frozen Chicken at Geylang Serai Market, said that though business has been stable as most of her customers are willing to accept chicken from other sources, she still hopes for the ban to end soon.

> She said: ""We are excited for the chicken to come back from Malaysia because many customers prefer it. We don't have a choice now but to sell the frozen chicken. But fresh chicken is nicer.""

> Malaysia imposed a ban on chicken exports from June 1 due to a shortage in the country. Exports were halted so that prices and supplies there could stabilise.

> While kampung chicken and black chicken from Malaysia are now available in Singapore, commercial broiler chicken - which makes up the majority of Singapore's chicken imports from Malaysia - is still banned.

> According to the Singapore Food Agency, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply comes from Malaysia, with most chickens imported live and slaughtered here.

> Hawker stalls that sell mainly chicken dishes have also been affected by the export ban. Chicken rice stall owners that ST spoke to said they have had to increase the price of their dish by 50 cents to $1 to continue making a profit.

> Ms Xu Haixia, 42, who owns Teck Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice at Kovan 209 Market & Food Centre, said a plate of chicken rice from her stall now costs $4.50, up from $3.50.

> She said: ""Prices have been adjusted upwards due to supply constraints for frozen chicken. Business has also decreased because the taste of frozen chicken is different.""

> The area has one of the largest and most biodiverse secondary forests in Singapore.

> National water agency PUB said the upgrading of the aged Choa Chu Kang Waterworks, which is the only plant supplying treated reservoir water to the western part of Singapore, is vital for the nation's water security.

> It added that it will take steps to reduce the impact on wildlife. Work to clear the forest is expected to start next year.

> About 3.2ha of vegetation south of the existing site will be cleared for the expansion of the plant, which dates back to 1975. This is equivalent to the size of about six football fields.

> An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project was completed at the end of last year.

> Members of the nature community in Singapore were consulted by PUB in March this year, and the report was published on PUB's website on Monday evening (July 4).

> The report, by sustainability consultancy firm Tembusu Asia Consulting, said the works are expected to negatively impact the flora and fauna in the Western Catchment forest.

> The entire Western Catchment area, which houses a number of reservoirs and is also used by the military, is bound by Tuas in the south, the Johor Strait in the west, Lim Chu Kang to its north and Tengah to its east.

> Wildlife in the area include the fern Helminthostachys zeylanica, which was found for the first time in Singapore during the biodiversity surveys done as part of the EIA.

> The affected plot is also home to critically endangered Sunda pangolins and straw-headed bulbuls.

> Two freshwater forest streams, considered rare habitats in Singapore, will also be affected by the works, said the report.

> Surveys had shown that the streams are home to the critically endangered elf dragonfly. The Johnson's freshwater crab - a species found nowhere else in the world - has also been recorded in the streams there.

> SINGAPORE — Tokyo Paralympics double gold-medallist Yip Pin Xiu won her third Sportswoman of the Year accolade at the Singapore Disability Sports Awards ceremony, held at the ParkRoyal@Beach Road on Wednesday (6 July).

> The 30-year-old, who had recently won two golds at the World Para Swimming Championships, had retained both her golds at last year's Tokyo Paralympics, making her by far the most successful Singapore Paralympian with five golds and one silver won since 2008.

> Her third Sportswoman of the Year honour pulls her level with para-swimmer and good friend Theresa Goh, who also won the accolade three times from 2004 to 2006.

> ""To win three consecutive Sportswoman of the Year awards is recognition of the consistent effort that my team and myself has gone through,"" Yip said after the ceremony.

> ""I'm really, really grateful for the support the entire ecosystem behind me. And hopefully, in the next couple of years, I will also be getting faster times and better results.""

> Meanwhile, Yip's coach Mark Chay - who was recently elected unopposed as the president of the Singapore Swimming Association - was awarded his second Coach of the Year (High Performance) honours, despite entering the para-swimming scene just three years ago.

> Another para-swimmer, Toh Wei Soong, secured his first Sportsman of the Year award after his national record-breaking fourth-place finish in the men's 50m butterfly final at the Tokyo Paralympics. Toh, 23, had been previously awarded Sportsboy of the Year in 2019 and 2020.

> ""The Sportsman of the Year award is a transition for me as a more mature and experienced athlete,"" Toh said.

> ""As someone who is moving into the later half of his career, the question is not so much whether I make the standard, but how much further can I raise the standard, not just for myself but for the rest of my sport.""

> Colin Soon, 17, earned the Sportsboy of the Year honour after winning four golds at the 2021 Asian Youth Para Games. The Sportsgirl of the Year went to 20-year-old sprinter Siti Nurhayati Ali Aksar Khan, who took a silver at the Asian Youth Para Games despite losing her father just before the competition.

> Soon's coach Roland Tan was awarded Coach of the Year (Development), while boccia duo Aloysius Gan and Yan Jia Yi was named Team of the Year for winning Singapore’s first boccia medal at the Asian Youth Para Games.

> A Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Tan Ju Seng, the longest-serving Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) president (12 years) and the first president of the Singapore National Paralympic Council.

> During his acceptance speech, Tan spoke about how difficult it was for the SDSC to garner support in the early years since its inauguration in 1973, and it was not until Yip won her first gold at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics that the disability sports scene finally gained prominence and acceptance in Singapore.

> His speech moved many of the para-athletes at the ceremony, and Yip said, ""I was just 16 at the Beijing Paralympics, so I didn't understand how much work went behind getting me to the start of the pool.

> ""Now, I've understood how everybody had to push so much get all the funding just to get us athletes to Beijing, and then things got better. It's really been a journey and, even though we are still facing certain challenges, we are definitely working towards making para-sports more prominent and accessible.""

> The awards night was presented by Haw Par Corporation, whose group general manager Brian Loo presented a $120,000 cheque to SDSC to continue its support of the Boccia team in their trainings and competitions, as well as introducing the sport to the wider community.

Most importantly i feel that the layout can be improved. Your layout has a lot of empty space, and proportion of text vs box seems off with squares. Long rectangles can do the job better since bus stop names are quite long. Also you might want to consider to bigger stop names (which is the most important information in that square) and smaller stop number (not as important).

If you want to go a step further, you can try to condense bus stop info, bus number, shortest bus timing and its capacity in a single card and display it on the main screen so you can quick glance important info with few taps less. As far as i know, i don't think any other app does this.

So example, a single rectangular card can look like:

987654 Marina Beh 

1N  |  3R  |   5    |  72  |  420

Arr |  4m |  7m  |  2m |  69m

Color code the bus number to indicate its crowdedness. If too many bus number then scroll sideways. Tap the card to display more info like next & next next bus timing, bus direction, bus stop distance, etc.

The issues i can see with this is text size too small (but then again your current app text is already small) and data usage since you load everything on the main page.",2022-07-07 11:44:21+08:00,14,False

> Imagine, what if there was no deterrence against smoking or littering in public places?

> Can we honestly believe we can nudge people to clear their plates after eating or educate errant cyclists to share footpaths?

> We even had to ban chewing gum in order to stop bad behaviour.

> So, I am puzzled that whenever the topic of noisy neighbours is discussed, we keep receiving advice to be friendly, as if doing that will naturally stop abusive neighbours.

> Thus, unless we frame the issue of noisy neighbours as a public nuisance that requires imposing an appropriate deterrence to stop such bad behaviour, victims of such abusive neighbours will continue to suffer in silence.

> He developed fever and a sore throat on Jul 4 and sought medical attention where initial tests for other possible medical conditions were done.

> ""When these tests returned negative, he was subsequently conveyed to NCID on 6 July, where he was isolated for further assessment,"" said MOH.

> As of Wednesday, three close contacts - two housemates and one social contact - have been identified.

> All close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days from their last contact with the case. Contact tracing is ongoing, said MOH.

> MOH said it will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and calibrate its preparedness and response measures as needed.

> ""Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health and maintaining good hygiene, especially during travel,"" it added.

> SINGAPORE: The owner of an online retail shop was fined on Wednesday (Jul 6) for illegally importing seafood, meat products and processed food from China.

> Lui Whatt Beng, the sole proprietor of Lui Fammart, was fined S$8,000, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) in a media release.

> ""Our investigation revealed that Lui had illegally imported these products from China and had been selling them online,"" said the agency.

> Food imports in Singapore can only be brought in by licensed importers. Every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit, said SFA.

> ""Illegally imported food products are of unknown sources and pose food safety risk,"" it added.

> Offenders who illegally import meat or fish products face a maximum fine of S$50,000, a jail term of up to two years, or both.

> SINGAPORE - A 31-year-old Malaysian drug trafficker on death row failed in an 11th hour attempt on Wednesday (July 6) for a stay on his execution scheduled on Thursday (July 7).

> The lawyer for Kalwant Singh Jogindar Singh argued before the Court of Appeal that his client had given information to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) about a suspect who was eventually arrested.

> Lawyer Too Xing Ji told the packed courtroom that the CNB does not deny that the suspect was arrested in a white Honda Integra car that Kalwant Singh had informed the bureau about.

> Mr Too said there was an arguable case that Kalwant Singh had substantively assisted the CNB.

> Under the law, drug couriers who are certified by the prosecution to have substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities can be sentenced to life imprisonment and caning instead of the death penalty.

> The three-judge court described Mr Too's efforts as ""valiant"" but dismissed the application for a stay of execution.

> Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the CNB has stated on oath that it did not use the information provided by Kalwant Singh.

> The CNB stated that the information that led to the suspect's arrest was the result of investigations into a unrelated case.

> Leaving aside the lateness of the application, Kalwant Singh bore the burden of putting forward evidence to show that the CNB had used the information he provided, said the chief justice.

> After the application was dismissed, Mr Too asked the court to let Kalwant Singh's family members see him one last time.

> Kalwant Singh had attended the hearing via video conference.

> Mr Too also asked to be allowed to make one last phone call to his client.

> Chief Justice Menon said these were matters for the Singapore Prison Service to assist and urged prosecutors to help in the arrangements.

> Kalwant Singh was convicted in June 2016 of two charges involving 181.05g of heroin in total.

> He was jointly tried with two others - Mohamad Yazid Md Yusof and Norasharee Gous.

> SINGAPORE: A man who was convicted of raping a stranger's blindfolded girlfriend in a ""threesome"" planned without the woman's knowledge in 2016 has had his jail sentence reduced after an appeal.

> Srihari Mahendran, 26, was convicted after a High Court trial in 2020 and initially sentenced to 17 years and 10 months' jail and 14 strokes of the cane.

> The Court of Appeal on Thursday (Jul 6) reduced his jail term to 16 years and six months, citing the need for parity with his co-accused. His caning sentence was untouched.

> Parity refers to the principle that people who commit the same offences should generally receive the same penalty, all other factors being equal.

> In this case, Srihari's lawyer Edmond Pereira asked the Court of Appeal to reduce his client's jail term to 14 to 16 years to reflect his lower culpability and other mitigating factors compared to the co-accused.

> Srihari's co-accused, the victim's then boyfriend, was sentenced to 19 years and 11 months' jail and 24 strokes of the cane on appeal.

> Six trains stalled and commuters on board got off safely at their nearest stations, said the transport operator.

> ""There was full lighting and ventilation in the stalled train while the commuters were on-board,"" said SMRT, adding that engineers have been deployed to fix the issue.

> Free regular and bridging bus services have been activated. In a tweet, SMRT advised passengers to travel along the North-South and Circle lines.

> ""Additional staff have been deployed to assist with crowd management. We are sorry to have affected commuters' peak-hour journeys,"" said SMRT.

> There are nine stations operating along the Thomson-East Coast Line, stretching from Woodlands North to Caldecott. The first three stations - Woodlands, Woodlands North and Woodlands South - opened to the public in January 2020, while six began passenger service in August 2021.

> Eleven more stations along the line, including those running through Stevens, Orchard and Outram Park, are expected to start service in the second half of this year.

> The last time Singapore reported more daily cases than this was on Mar 22 this year, when 13,166 infections were logged.

> There were two fatalities, taking the death toll from coronavirus complications to 1,421.

> A total of 683 patients are in hospital, according to the latest infection statistics on the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website on Tuesday night. Seventy-seven patients require oxygen supplementation.

> A total of 16 patients are in the intensive care unit.

> The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.34. This refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before, with a figure above 1 indicating that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising.

> The week-on-week infection ratio has been above 1 since Jun 14.

> Singapore's recent spike in COVID-19 cases comes after Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last month that the country can expect a new wave of infections in July or August, as people's antibodies from vaccinations and infections from the last Omicron wave start to wane.

> SINGAPORE - Prices of food, transportation and energy here have been going up so fast that Singapore is now facing a cost-of-living crisis, said Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim on Tuesday (July 5).

> He added in Parliament that the situation has gone beyond an inflation problem, and stressed that the Government must do more to help.

> ""When the prices of what we eat, getting to work, and keeping our homes and businesses running are all rising rapidly, this isn't an inflation problem any longer,"" he said.

> ""It is a cost-of-living crisis. It is therefore incumbent on policymakers to do what they can to alleviate the pain felt by the people.""

> Associate Professor Lim (Sengkang GRC) suggested several ways this could be done, including strengthening the Singapore dollar and spending more funds to support those who need it the most.

> In response, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said that the Government plans and executes its fiscal policies for the long term, but maintains dexterity to zoom into details that matter on the ground to Singaporeans as well as local businesses.

> Its approach focuses on strong job creation and wage growth as the best ways to help Singaporeans tide over the current economic difficulties, and on making sure that the country has sufficient resources to tackle long-term challenges.

> ""This mindset and bias towards action have allowed us to weather storms and seize opportunities throughout our history. This is the hallmark of our government,"" he said.

> ""This is our commitment to Singapore, and we will continue to do our utmost to deliver on this commitment. Especially in these challenging times.""

> Mr Tan added that there is a need to recognise the global nature of price pressures that Singapore is facing.

> The sharp rise in food and oil prices since the fourth quarter of last year principally reflects the effects of serious disruption of global supply, including the Ukraine conflict, he said. “It is inevitable that some of these price increases will affect our economy.”

> On strengthening the Singapore dollar, Prof Lim said that doing so will reduce the cost of imported goods and services. A stronger currency could lower domestic inflation as well, given how so much of what is consumed here is imported.

> He added that there is ample evidence that such strengthening is affordable, given how standard metrics for comparing the under and overvaluation of the Singapore dollar suggest that it is significantly undervalued.

> Doing so could be as simple as ceasing interventions that restrain Singapore's exchange rate, and allowing foreign exchange markets to work, he said. ""This is a luxury that precious few countries can afford, but one that we can leverage now.""

> Mr Tan said Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), takes several factors into account when it comes to the exchange rate.

> Strengthening this rate cannot fully offset global prices without causing immediate negative consequences on growth, and therefore, the labour market, he warned.

> He said this is why many advanced central banks are guarded in the speed and the extent to which they will raise interest rates.

> ""Monetary policy action in and of themselves have attendant spillover effects that must be taken into account in the uncertain challenging economic environment. Therefore, a judicious blend of tight monetary policy and targeted supportive fiscal policy that is carefully calibrated is most appropriate,"" he said.

> The last two salary reviews for teachers were in October 2015 and September 2012.

> In 2012, teachers and allied educators received a pay rise of between 5 and 15 per cent. Classroom teachers got an 8 per cent raise, which was meant to keep pace with the market, MOE said at that time.

> The 2015 review led to a 4 per cent to 9 per cent increase for teachers.

> He was responding to a question from Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) on whether his ministry would consider giving greater pay incentives to school counsellors across primary, secondary and tertiary institutions to attract sufficient counsellors of the highest quality and ensure low student-to-counsellor ratios.

> Mr Chan added that MOE and the institutes of higher learning periodically review salaries of staff to ensure pay packages remain competitive.

> Adjustments are also made, where necessary, to keep pace with the market, he added.

> Said Mr Chan: ""Besides competitive remuneration, counsellors are provided opportunities for professional development and growth, which is important for staff attraction and retention.

> ""MOE supports counsellors in honing their counselling competencies through courses and regular clinical supervision and consultation sessions with their clinical supervisor.""

> He did not elaborate on when the review would be completed, or by how much salaries would be adjusted.

> In June, the Government said 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 this year.

> It said at the time that these adjustments would not apply to civil servants in specialised schemes, such as accountants, police officers, teachers and foreign service officers.

> A Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Marine Parade has been sold for S$1.01 million, setting the record for the highest price for an HDB resale transaction in the estate.

> The five-room flat is on the 24th floor and has an unblocked view of East Coast Park from every window in the house.

> The unit

> According to The Straits Times (ST), the flat has a good size of 126sqm, a panoramic view of East Coast Park and is a five-minute walk away from Tao Nan School.

> Because of these factors, the sellers told ST that they were confident that the unit would fetch a good price.

> The unit also has a recess area, which is an additional free space outside the unit, that was bought by the unit's first owners.

> Also, under an upgrading programme for the estate in 1997, the unit has an additional utility room which was constructed by HBD, according to ST.

> Final price of $1,010,888

> According to ST, the sellers of the home, a Singaporean couple with three kids, were willing to let go of their home if they were offered a price above the S$1 million mark.

> This is the first flat in the Marine Parade area sold for that price.

> The sale was handled by PropNex property agents Colin Wong and Brian Ying, who told ST that it was the view from the unit that attracted buyers and helped with the deal.

> The unit was initially listed at S$999,000, but three interested buyers offered prices above $1 million.

> The sellers are the second owners of the unit. They bought it at approximately S$870,000 about 11 years ago.

> Despite having 51 years and nine months left on its 99-year lease, the property agents managed to close the deal a week after the unit was listed.

> The agents said that most interested buyers were older, living in private properties and looking to downgrade and settle in their last home.

> So, the age of the flat was not a concern.

> The price was finalised at $1,010,888 after four to five rounds of negotiation.

> Paid COV of under S$100,000

> One of the agents, Ying, said the buyers paid a Cash Over Valuation (COV) that was a little under S$100,000.

> According to Property Guru, COV is the difference between the agreed sale price of the flat between seller and buyer and its actual valuation by HDB. The amount must be paid in cash.

> COV is used to negotiate the price of the unit and is described by the site as ""overpaying"" for the resale unit since it tends to be above its valuation by HDB.

> In a case where the resale price is equal to the valuation of the flat, the buyers wouldn't need to pay COV.

> HBD resale prices on the rise

> On Jun. 9, real estate portal SRX reported that HDB resale prices have been on the rise for the 23rd straight month in May 2022.

> In late June 2022, a four-room HDB flat in Tiong Bahru was sold for S$1.158 million.

> Three executive HDB resale flats in Pasir Ris and Woodlands were sold for over a million dollars in May 2022, a first for both estates.

> SINGAPORE: Hospitals and residential care homes will impose limits on the number of visitors for four weeks from Thursday (Jul 7) amid a rise in COVID-19 community cases in Singapore.

> There will also be a cap on the duration of visits to these facilities, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> The measures - which will be in effect from Jul 7 to Aug 3 – are to protect healthcare capacity as well as vulnerable patients and residents during this period, said MOH.

> HOSPITAL VISITS

> All patients will be allowed two pre-designated visitors for the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at the bedside at any one time.

> Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors while two visitors may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time.

> The duration of a visit will be limited to 30 minutes.

> “In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals’ discretion,” said the Health Ministry.

> It added that all visitors should ensure that they are well and are ""strongly encouraged"" to test themselves with an antigen rapid test (ART) on the day of the visit.

> MOH said hospitals have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients.

> “Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patients’ beds.”

> RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES

> All residents at care homes will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one visitor may visit at any one time. The visit duration will be limited to 30 minutes.

> MOH said visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the home ahead of time. These visitors should also ensure that they are well, and are strongly encouraged to perform a self-test for COVID-19 on the day of the visit.

> “Visitors should strictly adhere to prevailing safe management measures within the Homes. This includes remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards.

> “We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details,” added MOH.

> The Health Ministry said all visitors must wear face masks with good filtration capability at all times while visiting hospitals or residential care homes. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric.

> MOH said that it will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving situation.

> “We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions and residential care homes.”

> SINGAPORE: Months before the impending closures of True Group fitness chains in Malaysia and Thailand, then CEO Patrick John Wee Ewe Seng was still allowing the sale of new gym memberships of up to five years.

> Staff in Malaysia did not even know about True Group's closure in the country until one day before, while gym members in Thailand were only informed on the day of the closure itself.

> In a judgment made available on Tuesday (Jul 5), a High Court judge found that Mr Wee's mismanagement of the closures of True Group's companies in Malaysia and Thailand was a breach of his duties to three other companies in the group.

> Mr Wee was the CEO and founder of True Group, which runs the True Yoga and True Fitness chains, from March 2008 until his termination in May 2018.

> The lawsuit was brought against him by three Singapore-incorporated companies in the group - True Yoga, True Fitness and True Fitness (STC).

> According to the plaintiffs, Mr Wee knew that True Group (Malaysia) was facing impending closure as early as February 2017. The company ceased operations on Jun 10, 2017.

> But he allowed the company to publicise and sell long-term gym memberships ranging from one-year to five-year periods until May 2017, with 43 such memberships sold before the closure.

> The plaintiffs said that he misled gym members by putting up a notice at one of the gyms saying that it was closed for renovation on May 10, 2017, when it was in fact closed for the court bailiff to take inventory under a writ of seizure for unpaid rental arrears.

> They also argued that Mr Wee conducted pre-sales for a new club in Plaza Damas, a development in Kuala Lumpur, that never opened, selling 50 such memberships from November 2016 to May 2017.

> As for True Group (Thailand), the plaintiffs said Mr Wee allowed membership fees to be collected from almost 39,000 members each month until end-May 2017, despite his knowledge of the impending closure.

> They accused him of allowing the sale of gym memberships of up to three years to prospective members, up to the first week of June 2017. The company ceased operations on Jun 9, 2017.

> They also argued that instead of dealing with the fallout from the closure, Mr Wee appointed one Ms Moonjaisai, the wife of his friend's tailor, to be sole director and his ""scapegoat"" once the closure came into effect, the judgment stated.

> The plaintiffs said that Mr Wee failed to provide gym members in Thailand with alternative fitness facilities after the closure. For those in Malaysia, there was an arrangement to use CHI Fitness facilities, but this abruptly ended in January 2018.

> Mr Wee's lawyers argued that his actions leading up to the closures were ""commercial decisions made in the best interests of True Group (Malaysia) and True Group (Thailand) given the circumstances"", the judgment stated.

> He also counterclaimed for wrongful termination and unpaid salary of S$120,000 a month for the period of Jan 1, 2018 to May 9, 2019, and salary in lieu of a year's notice for his termination.

> The plaintiffs argued that Mr Wee's termination was justified under his employment contract on the grounds of ""wilful misconduct or gross negligence"" in his mismanagement of the closures, the judgment stated.

> In his judgement, Justice Choo Han Teck agreed that Mr Wee had known that the True Group companies in Malaysia and Thailand were facing financial difficulties and impending closure since February 2017.

> He said Mr Wee knew that the True Group chains in Malaysia and Thailand would not be able to fulfil the long-term memberships they were still selling.

> ""The defendant ought to have known that the members would be outraged, and reasonably so, upon the closure of the gyms which would in turn damage True Group's reputation and businesses in other countries,"" said the judge.

> These actions taken in the lead up to the closures breached Mr Wee's duty to act diligently and in the best interests of the plaintiffs in managing the closures, said Justice Choo.

> He also said that Mr Wee's conduct suggested ""he was more concerned with evading responsibility as a director"" rather than dealing with the consequences of the closures on staff and gym members.

> Justice Choo cited Mr Wee's resignation days before the closure of True Group (Thailand), leaving Ms Moonjaisai as sole director to handle the winding up and creditors' claims, and his similar resignation before the closure of True Group (Malaysia).

> ""While these actions may not be breaches of the defendant's director duties in themselves, they shed light on his priorities and personal interests in managing the closures,"" said the judge.

> ""The evidence shows that Ms Moonjaisai was at a complete loss as to how to deal with the closure of the business,"" he added.

> Justice Choo also ruled that Mr Wee was entitled to unpaid salary of about S$62,660, but found that his employment was not wrongfully terminated.

> The judge reserved the issues of costs and quantification of the plaintiff's losses to a later date.

Singapore has already signed two agreements with advanced air mobility startups Skyports Ltd. and Volocopter GmbH that may convert the aging aerodrome into a vertiport, or an airport where the aerial devices take off and land vertically, Jetsons-style.

> It isn’t some way off dream, either. Plans for flying taxis to be operational at Seletar are pretty immediate — as soon as 2024 — and the airport, or vertiport, could serve as a global model for what the future of mobility may look like.

> Recent interest in so-called eVTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles) has been immense. Electric cabs stole the limelight at this year’s Singapore Air Show in February with Malaysian tycoon Tony Fernandes of AirAsia fame placing an order to rent at least 100 of them from Vertical Aerospace Ltd. Carriers including American Airlines Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. have also ordered scores of eVTOLs.

> “Singapore is, and continues to strive to be, the world leader in mobility, and this development is another brick in that wall,” said Sunny Xi, a principal at consultancy Oliver Wyman’s transportation and services practice. “This is more than simply solving traffic on roads. Singapore has all the right ingredients to test, learn and scale both the mobility adoption and the business to then export it across the world.”

> But flying taxis — until recently the stuff of science fiction — have one big and crucial hurdle to clear. Not one has been approved by regulators anywhere to actually take to the skies with passengers onboard. Authorities can take years to approve new technology and it’s only recently that flying taxis have a taken the giant leap from being a concept to a reality. Regulators are now examining the safety of such vehicles before green lighting them for commercial operations.

> Companies like Volocopter say it’s just a matter of time, and Asia will play a large role in eVTOL adoption.

> “In Asia, you have a high concentration of mega cities that you don’t have in any other region,” Christian Bauer, Volocopter’s chief commercial officer, said in an interview. “This new industry is innovative, it’s good for inhabitants, for tourists, and also for cross-border connections to relieve the pain of congestion.”

> Volocopter, which predicts S$4.2 billion ($3 billion) of cumulative economic benefits to Singapore and as many as 1,300 local jobs by 2030 from the industry, is showcasing its aircraft in the city-state later this month to increase public awareness. It’s also talked up the “political benefits” including reduced car ownership and the ability of Singapore to position itself as a torchbearer for the rest of Asia.

> Fares for passengers are expected to start at about 40% of the cost of a helicopter, according to Bauer. That could drop to around the price of a premium taxi within five to six years, he said.

> “This makes it interesting for anyone who can afford a taxi to take a Volocopter instead,” Bauer said, adding that the company’s service will be “very silent compared to a helicopter. You will not hear it at all.”

> Volocopter’s backers include Chinese automaking powerhouse Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. as well as German logistics firm DB Schenker and the venture capital arm of chipmaker Intel Corp. Skyports is supported by Japan’s Kanematsu Corp. and Goodman Group in Australia, and counts Ken Allen, the CEO of DHL eCommerce, as a board member.

> For all the behind-the-scenes work, the burgeoning revolution underway at Seletar isn’t visible yet.

> On a recent visit, the airfield was littered with private and small trainer planes, with a few bigger jets in hangars undergoing repairs. Patrons at an aviation-themed bistro overlooking the runway were mostly expats or locals with jobs at nearby plane-maintenance companies. Inside the terminal, staff were busy guiding a handful of passengers onto a flight to Subang Jaya in Malaysia — one of the only two commercial services operating from the airport.

> Singapore’s Jurong Town Corporation , commonly known at JTC and a primary state-run developer of real estate, is bullish on Seletar’s scope. The broader area surrounding the airstrip, called Seletar Aerospace Park, is the centerpiece of Singapore’s aerospace industry cluster and home to around 60 companies spanning businesses from engine makers, repairs, research and training.

> “The future of urban air mobility is exciting and presents far-reaching possibilities for Seletar Aerospace Park,” Lim Ai Ting, JTC’s director of aerospace and marine cluster, said. “We’re currently in discussions with various parties on new partnerships. This will add to the park’s vibrancy and also benefit the aerospace industry ecosystem.”

> With about 82,500 passenger eVTOLs expected to be operational in Asia Pacific by 2050, the region will account for around half the global market, according to a study by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and consultancy Roland Berger released earlier this year. The flying devices could be used as airport shuttles, for tourist flights or inter-city travel, flying as far as 250 kilometres (155 miles) on a single charge, according to the study.

> “With its high-rise and high-density landscape, and highly efficient domestic transport systems, the vision in Singapore is focused first on tourist flights, and ultimately, regional connectivity,” said Yun Yuan Tay, Skyports’ head of APAC. Seletar, with its integrated cluster of aerospace-related facilities, is “the perfect setting for the holistic development of an industry as new as advanced air mobility,” he said.

> More broadly, eVTOLs’ advancement isn’t limited to just Singapore, or Asia.

> A unit of Kenya Airways Plc agreed last month to buy as many as 40 flying taxis starting in 2026 from EVE UAM, part of US-headquartered Eve Holding Inc. And England’s Coventry, once known as Britain’s motor city, is gearing up to host what’s being billed as the first-ever fully functional hub for flying taxis this spring. The site, on a car parking lot at a busy junction across the road from Coventry’s main railway station, is being developed by Urban-Air Port Ltd., a London-based startup that competes with Skyports.

> “The good thing is, a couple of years back, we were approaching cities,” said Volocopter’s Bauer. “Now cities are approaching Volocopter because they see the demand, they see this revolutionary change, and they want to be there. Singapore is high on the list.”

> Outside of regulatory approval, another hurdle is range, with eVTOLs’ flying time relatively limited. Potential electrification of popular passenger planes like Airbus SE’s A320s series or Boeing Co.’s 737 family has been largely ruled out due to the immense weight of the batteries that would be required to fly hundreds of miles.

> The fact the aerial devices are electric isn’t going to put much of a dent in aviation’s huge carbon footprint, either.

> About 80% of the industry’s carbon emissions come from flights longer than 1,500 kilometres, which is why flying taxis won’t be a solution in the near term, the International Air Transport Association’s Director General Willie Walsh said in May. The biggest lobby group for airlines is “conservative” about the impact the technology will have on the industry’s path to net zero, Walsh said.

> Oliver Wyman’s Xi agrees. He sees all-electric propulsion restricted to short-haul aircraft applications for mainly commuter, or between nine to 19 seat, applications.

> “Without significant improvements in the specific energy density of batteries compared to kerosene, it’s unlikely that electric planes will threaten modern commercial aviation.”

> The age threshold will be increased in phases from April 2023, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling in Parliament. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will aim to complete the expansion of the scheme by October next year.

> ""This can only be done when the number of AA volunteers is increased,"" said Ms Sun, referring to volunteers under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS).

> Under the AAYS, an appropriate adult - an independent, trained volunteer - is activated for all suspects under the age of 16 during police interviews.

> MHA had said last year that it is reviewing the scheme to see if it could be extended to suspects who are 16 and 17 years old. This came after the case of 17-year-old drug suspect Justin Lee, who died after falling from height, months after his arrest.

> Justin was arrested in February 2021 and charged with drug trafficking offences in June, before being released on bail. He died on Sep 16.

> The Central Narcotics Bureau launched an investigation into how Justin was treated and questioned after his mother alleged that he was mistreated during the process.

> While the agency concluded that he was treated ""professionally and fairly"" during investigations, and that there was ""no mistreatment"" when he was in the lock-up, the case prompted questions from MPs at that time about law enforcement agencies' protocols when dealing with young suspects.

I get massive headaches and I can’t concentrate on work when they start their antics. 

First I went up to talk to them about it, they were aggressive and said “they are kids what you want me to do”. Then they started denying that their kids made the noise and tried to push the blame to their neighbour (80 year old couple that holds some temple ritual thing once in a blue moon) and their neighbour above them who drags their chairs (what’s the link??). 

I had no choice but to contact town council after that and they went down to talk to them, but to no avail. No choice but to call the police on them but the police said they can’t do much also. 

Then did mediation at the CMC, the mediator was far from understanding and neutral, seemed to side with them and said that their suggestion that the sound came from their neighbour to the side and above them was plausible (how is that possible when my lights are vibrating and i can tell exactly which direction and where they are running).

> Will you leave your job if you're asked to go back into the office everyday?

> Younger workers, those between 18 and 34, are more reluctant than their older colleagues to return to the workplace full-time, amid Singapore’s reopening and employers encouraging staff to go back into the office.

> These are results from the ADP Research Institute’s People at Work 2022: A Global Workforce View that was published on July 4.

> According to the survey of almost 33,000 workers in 17 countries, more than seven in 10 (71%) of 18-24 year olds and two thirds (66%) of 25-34 year olds would consider looking for another job if their employer insisted on a full-time return to the workplace, compared to 56% of the 45-54 age bracket.

> In Singapore, more than five in 10 younger workers (between the ages of 18-24 and 25-34) would contemplate leaving if asked to return to work full-time. In comparison, only 35% of Singapore workers above 55 years old would contemplate quitting if this happened.

> This could be a potential friction point as some industries, such as construction, manufacturing and F&B, may not be able to implement a hybrid work system. Industries like F&B and retail also have a higher reliance on younger workers, as compared to other industries.

> Yvonne Teo, Vice President of HR, ADP, comments: “As lockdowns have eased in different countries, the question of whether workers can be compelled to return to the workplace full-time is a divisive topic. For many it could be a pivotal issue, potentially triggering a decision to leave.”

> “It is worth investigating the willingness of workers to return to the office and balancing this with what would work best for the business. When workers return to the office, managers have important roles to make in-person collaborations meaningful to engage younger workers. This will help to build a more connected internal culture and enhance trust and loyalty between employers and staff,” adds Teo, who is aware of the challenges for certain industries such as manufacturing, retail and F&B, which have job scopes that tough to implement a hybrid or flexible work schedule.

> SINGAPORE: The current wave of COVID-19 infections will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Jul 5).

> Responding to a parliamentary question from MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) about the Government's response to the current wave of COVID-19 cases, Mr Ong said the authorities had anticipated this wave when they learnt of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.

> These subvariants have a ""significant growth advantage"" over the earlier BA.2 subvariant, he added.

> “This wave, however, arrived slightly earlier than the July and August timeframe that we anticipated,” the Health Minister said.

> “For this current wave, our assessment is that it will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year. This is because many more of us have gained stronger immunity either through booster shots or recovery from infections,"" he added.

> “This will significantly impede the circulation and transmission of the virus.”

> COVID-19 case numbers on Tuesday are expected to be more than 12,000, about 10 per cent more than Tuesday last week, he noted.

> ""There are indications that we are near the peak, if not at the peak, and we should be relieved that the number this week did not double from last week. Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" said Mr Ong.

> In response to a question from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) if healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”.

> This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.

> “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated (intensive care unit) and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.

> There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied.

> The facilities were “recently consolidated” from more than 2,000 beds to about 1,300 beds, with a “higher manning ratio”, said Mr Ong. This makes it easier to transfer patients from hospitals to the facilities without a “significant drop” in levels of care, he added.

> However, public hospitals continue to face “high demand” from non-COVID-19 patients, said Mr Ong.

> “Over time, we hope more of our (COVID-19 treatment facilities) can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,” he added.

> The COVID-19 treatment facility at Sengkang Community Hospital has been “reconfigured” to this new model, and the authorities will explore converting other facilities, said the Health Minister.

> In anticipating the wave of infections, the Government maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were “low and stable”, to “moderate the infection rate” when the new wave arrived.

> “If we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent safe management measures will need to be implemented. And that means reintroducing things like group sizes, capacity limits and masking outdoors,” said Mr Ong.

> ""We cannot rule out these steps when we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey to endemicity.""

> SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for eight weeks on Tuesday (Jul 5) for taking nude videos of his ex-girlfriend with a spy camera in the room that they used to share.

> The 48-year-old man pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the woman's modesty. Another two similar charges were considered for sentencing.

> The victim's identity is protected by gag order, and the man's name cannot be published as it could lead to her identification.

> The court heard that the man and his girlfriend broke up in September 2019, and he moved out of the room they shared. But he still had access to the room as he knew the password for the lock.

> In October 2019, he installed a pinhole camera in the room. He hid the camera among luggage, covering it with a black sheet that was used to keep dust off the luggage.

> The victim discovered the camera in November 2019 when she took the luggage out to pack her belongings. She viewed the videos recorded by the camera and realised that several of them captured her nude.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Shao Yan sought two months' jail, noting that the use of technology to make the recordings increased the potential for circulation of the nude videos.

> Defence counsel Chung Ting Fai asked for four weeks' jail, arguing that his client was motivated by curiosity and jealousy over his failed relationship with the victim.

> Mr Chung told the court that his client and the victim had lived together for seven years and travelled to China to meet each other's parents, and that his client intended to marry her.

> But the lawyer said his client suspected his girlfriend was unfaithful after viewing footage from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera they placed outside the room for security.

> When he confronted her about this, she denied ever bringing another man into their home, according to the lawyer.

> This led the offender to feel betrayed, saddened and jealous, said Mr Chung. He then decided to install the pinhole camera to ascertain if the victim was bringing another man home.

> The prosecution acknowledged these motivations, and Mr Ng said the sentence sought already took into account that his conduct did not appear to be for nefarious purposes.

> District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said that the man's actions nonetheless still constituted an invasion of the victim's privacy.

> The punishment for insulting a woman's modesty is up to a year in jail, a fine or both.

To my horror according to his words, his boss say no and wanted him to stay for the entire period and give a cb reply ""I have no obligation to care about a staff who is leaving"".

Wtf in the boss logic, the leaving staff also have no obligation to care about the team he is leaving, right?? Please tell me I am not the only one who felt this way?",2022-07-05 19:03:48+08:00,18,1657019921.0

They referred me to a family doctor trained with handling mental conditions; apparently it’s a new scheme that IMH is doing to ease the flow of patients coming through. 

The family doctor tried to pin down the cause of my anxiety attacks because mine were bad enough for me to forget my episodes after they happen. I asked him if I could get checked for ADHD because as a kid, I got a referral by the allied educator in school to get tested for it. Family doctor managed to pin down that my anxiety was caused by my ADHD being left undiagnosed and untreated. He referred me to IMH to an adult ADHD specialist. That appointment where he did that was two weeks ago. Got a call last night that my appointment is in October which isn’t as bad as the other people I’ve read who had to wait one year plus for an appointment.

I think I got the quicker route because I got diagnosed with anxiety from my undiagnosed ADHD, thus the family doctor referring me to specifically an adult ADHD specialist at IMH. 

If you can hang in there a little longer, just go through the public health route. If it’s affecting you very badly day to day like mine, then I recommend private. Also, don’t forget to bring a parent or someone who grew up with you. Witness accounts for your behaviour as a kid is key to getting your ADHD diagnosed.",2022-07-05 00:38:27+08:00,15,False

> Asked by Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) if the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has received any indication from the Malaysian authorities as to when they might review or end the ban, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said: ""The answer is no.""

> Speaking in Parliament on Monday (July 4) about Singapore's food security issues, Ms Fu said that while the Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to mitigate the risks of unavailability of supply, Singapore cannot fully prevent disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, extreme weather events, or policy decisions by foreign governments.

> She said: ""We will not be able to eliminate all risks. To so do would be costly and uneconomical. We will also not be able to isolate Singapore from the price fluctuations of food supply.""

> She added that in recent months, even countries with sizeable food production capacities have faced higher food prices because of higher costs of feedstock, fertilisers and transportation.

> Singapore's food security strategies include ensuring a diverse network of food sources, growing more food locally, and working closely with industry partners to maintain stockpiles of essential food items.

> Asked if the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has considered exploring the use of offshore islands such as Pulau Ubin for poultry or agricultural uses, Ms Fu acknowledged that such suggestions have commonly been heard during discussions on Singapore's food resilience plan.

> She said: ""I think our priority must be to meet a significant proportion of our food supply needs. Build up significant skill sets so that we have the production knowledge and capability onshore to support us in times of need.""

> She explained that the challenge for the country will be to increase food production with less than 1 per cent of land set aside for agri-food production.

> ""In many cases, we're looking at productivity to the multiple of 10 times of what we're doing now in order to give us the bulk that we need.""

> Addressing questions on Singapore's efforts to expand the number of approved countries for poultry imports, Ms Fu said: ""Even as we diversify our food sources, food safety remains paramount. Only accredited sources that meet Singapore's food safety and animal health standards will be allowed to export to Singapore. This has not hindered our diversification efforts. Specifically for chicken, 25 countries are accredited.""

> According to SFA, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply comes from Malaysia. Most of those chickens are imported live and slaughtered here. Singapore also receives chilled and frozen chicken from countries including Thailand, Australia and Brazil.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore prefers to focus on farming ""resource-efficient"" food items instead of poultry because of land, labour, energy and water constraints, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu in Parliament on Monday (Jul 4).

> ""We prefer to concentrate on farming food items that can be produced in a resource-efficient and commercially sustainable manner,"" she said.

> Citing data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Ms Fu said that the CO2-equivalent emissions generated from producing 1kg of chicken for meat are about three times that of some fish.

> Ms Fu was responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about Singapore's food supply and the impact of Malaysia's chicken export ban.

> Ms Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) asked if the authorities would consider setting local production targets for poultry and poultry products under Singapore's “30 by 30” food security goal to enhance the resilience of Singapore’s supply of poultry. Under the “30 by 30"" goal, Singapore aims to produce up to 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent today.

> Mr Shawn Huang (PAP-Jurong) asked about the impact of the chicken supply disruption and the Government's long-term approach to poultry supply in Singapore.

> A woman in Singapore was apprehended after she was seen confronting a couple who were hanging out and livestreaming in public.

> The couple, Clarence Kang, 39, and his wife Angelica Mendoza, 37, were sitting on the side of a covered pedestrian walkway outside Buona Vista MRT station when they were approached by a woman in pink wearing a skin care face mask.

> The incident, caught on the final two hours of a long livestream, was uploaded to the couple's account on June 28.

> The entire stream lasted some 14 hours.

> What happened

> At the 12 hours 28 minutes and 30 seconds mark, the woman in pink could be seen approaching the couple and telling them to stop what they were doing.

> The woman said: ""You are not supposed to do this here.""

> She continued: ""Switch off that thing before I call the police.""

> Kang replied: ""I'm just chatting with my friend.""

> Triggered by comments made by the husband

> When the woman repeated that she will call the police, Kang said: ""It's okay, you just call the police, go ahead ma'am. Thank you ah, have a nice day.""

> This remark apparently caused the woman to turn back.

> She said: ""Don't call me ma'am. I will not teach you anything.""

> The woman then continued: ""I will kick you. Do you want me to kick your ass?""

> The woman then walked beside Kang and his wife, which led Kang to ask: ""What are you trying to do?""

> The woman then told Kang: ""You are not supposed to eat here.""

> Kang responded that he was not even eating.

> Kicked food on ground

> She then walked over to the packed food on the ground and kicked them away.

> At this point, the couple finally retaliated.

> Kang threw a packet with drinks at the woman.

> Mendoza then smacked the woman on the back, before asking the woman: ""Why you kick like that? Why you hurting people for what?""

> Woman followed livestreamer around

> Kang then said to the camera that he will call the police.

> Kang and Mendoza asked the woman to compensate them for the food.

> All the while the woman continued to stand beside the couple.

> The woman then proceeded to walk towards Kang and followed him around as he walked away.

> This went on for several minutes.

> Took off her shoes

> Eight minutes after showing up, at the 12 hours 36 minutes and 30 seconds mark, the woman took off her shoes and continued to follow Kang around.

> All the while he tried to shake her off.

> Bystander stepped in

> At the 12 hours 37 minutes and 39 seconds mark, almost 10 minutes after the woman showed up, a bystander who was passing by stepped in to stop the woman with the skin care face mask.

> A minute later, the woman in the skin care face mask started screaming as she was pinned to the ground by the bystander.

> Kang said: ""This is really suay (unlucky), you know. Come here, eat, then kenna (encounter) this kind of thing.""

> All the while, the member of public who stepped in to help continued to hold the woman down.

> Woman started to sing

> At the 12 hours 43 minutes and 33 seconds mark, the woman wearing the skin care face mask started singing.

> The viewers who were tuned in at that time reacted in the comments section that they could not believe what they were seeing.

> At the 12 hours 44 minutes and 45 seconds mark, the police arrived.

> Kang stopped recording when he spoke to the police officer.

> Police responded to call for assistance

> According to The New Paper, the police said they received a call for assistance at 100 North Buona Vista Road on June 28 at 10.58pm, and apprehended a 41-year-old woman under Section 7(1) of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2008.

> Mendoza told TNP she is grateful to the passerby who helped them: “The Malay lady very kind, and helped us out of nowhere.”

> The couple let on that the food the woman had kicked over was partially paid for by their Twitch community, while the milk tea was a special order that one of their viewers from Malaysia had ordered for them via a food delivery service.

> Kang and Mendoza frequently livestream their lives with their four-year-old son on Twitch.

> SINGAPORE - Central Provident Fund (CPF) members’ balances have hit a new high, exceeding half a trillion dollars as at the end of last year.

> Their balances grew by 9.4 per cent to $505.7 billion – from $462.1 billion in 2020 – according to the CPF Board’s annual report released on Monday (July 4).

> A record $18.3 billion in interest was paid to members last year. In 2020, members received $16.8 billion in interest.

> Voluntary top-ups to Special and Retirement Accounts also climbed to a new high of $4.8 billion last year, up from $3 billion in 2020, said the report.

> The top-ups were made by 294,000 CPF members, with about half topping up for the first time.

> However, the amount withdrawn for housing has gone up. Some 996,000 members used a total of $21.9 billion of their CPF savings for their housing needs last year – a jump from the $17.3 billion in 2020.

> Last year, the number of CPF members increased by 2.0 per cent to 4.1 million.

> About 416,000 members received monthly CPF retirement payouts totalling $2.2 billion last year.

> Of these, more than 85,000 members are on the CPF Life scheme, which provides a lifelong monthly payout that begins when the member turns 65 years old.

> The CPF system provides members with a solid foundation for peace of mind in retirement, said CPF Board’s chairman Yong Ying-I in the report. “In 2021, we made efforts to strengthen this foundation, with schemes to boost the retirement income of members with lower balances and lesser means.”

> For instance, the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme was launched last year to help seniors who have not reached their Basic Retirement Sum to build their retirement savings through a dollar-for-dollar matching grant.

> Under this scheme, the government matches cash top-ups made to the Retirement Account of eligible Singaporeans aged 55 to 70, up to an annual cap of $600. Over 117,000 members benefitted from $68 million in matching grants from the government for cash top-ups made last year.

> According to the annual report, the CPF Board also assisted 8,496 members who were in financial distress amid the Covid-19 pandemic by connecting them with agencies that can provide help beyond what it can offer, under the Rejected Appeals Management Protocol initiative.

> The number of transactions performed on the CPF website and mobile app nearly doubled to 171 million last year, from 90 million in 2020.

I know your situation. I'm moving between various lodging locations so I can't commit to a landline so I recently went to ZYM which piggybacks on SingTel's network and got a SIM card plan for $28 for 70GB, this is the 'Max' plan. If you're only using it for 1 day then there are cheaper options, $9.90 for 9.9GB. 

https://zym.sg/

However, you will still need a 'modem' for the SIM card. You have 2 options from there on.

1) Use your phone. If your phone doesn't have dual SIM slot and you need to use your main number to contact your interviewer/whatever then you're shit out of luck on this. If it has dual SIM slot then you can put your new SIM card in it and use it as a hot spot transmitter. 

2) Get a 4G SIM card Modem Dongle. There are various brands. I bought TP-Link and it fucking sucks ass. I thought the more expensive would mean quality but no, it all sucks dick and there are various complaints on the forums. If you're getting a dongle, do NOT fucking get TP-link. My model for comparison is a M7450 which costs over $200 and resets constantly. Go get some other brand. This item costs ranges from $50 to $200+. Since you're only using it for 1 day, you should just get the cheapest imo. You basically slot the SIM card into the device turn it on and it'll automatically transmit its SSID. 

You can PM me if you have more questions on this.

TL;DR: $9.90 for cheapest ZYM SIM data plan, $50+ for the dongle to use that SIM or you can use your smartphone.",2022-07-04 11:55:05+08:00,15,1656907106.0

843,ierwfza,t3_vqwtbe,5kb8k,t3_vqwtbe,"Les Maisons is a low-rise development of just 14 units coming up on Nassim Road, a leafy street nestled between the bustling shopping district of Orchard Road on one end and the expansive quiet of the Singapore Botanic Gardens on the other. As Business Insider described it, Nassim is the Lion City’s very own Beverly Hills. And right now, property prices along this mile-long stretch of hyper-exclusivity are scorching hot.

In May, a 6,092 square-foot apartment in Maisons Nassim was sold by its Hong Kong-based developer Shun Tak Holdings, which is run by the late Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho’s daughters Pansy, Daisy and Maisy. It went for S$37 million ($27 million), the fourth-highest per square foot price on record for a new Singapore condo, according to OrangeTee & Tie, a property brokerage.

The buyer’s identity isn’t known. It could be a Singaporean tycoon who wrote the check, but the Les Maisons unit might well have been one of the 84 snapped up in May by foreigners, marking a big-bang return of global interest in Singapore property after the first quarter’s lull. Nor would it be a surprise if the money came from an expatriate banker: Permanent residents bought 142 units in May, compared with 79 the previous month.

Mind you, such things weren’t supposed to happen this year. For both foreigners and PRs, already-steep additional stamp duties were further raised in December. Foreigners have to shell out a 30% levy, while PRs now pay 25% on their second homes and an unchanged 5% on first purchases. Only Singapore citizens buying their first homes are exempt from additional duties, which sit on top of the standard graded rate that rises to a maximum of 4% above S$1 million of market value. Despite such high taxation, there’s suddenly no dearth of homebuyers in Singapore, either local or foreign. The inescapable conclusion is this: The city-state’s latest property curbs have already lost their sting.  

Will the Singapore authorities need to introduce more draconian restrictions? Maybe not this year, provided the U.S. Federal Reserve remains hawkish enough to deliver a second 75-basis-point increase in interest rates in July.

Since the 2009 start of the global cheap-money era, Singapore has made 11 attempts to rein in speculation in its residential property market. The goal has been to prevent prices from rising too fast too soon; the tools have ranged from higher stamp duties to lower mortgage loan-to-value limits and stricter debt servicing ratios for homebuyers. But the effect of these so-called cooling measures doesn’t last. “Sentiment typically recovers around two to six months after each round,” says Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.

This time, it’s back to business-as-usual in five months. After surging 10.6% in 2021, Singapore home prices inched up by just 0.7% in the first quarter. However, developer sales for May seem to suggest strong pent-up demand. What’s more, activity appears to be heating up when money is no longer cheap. DBS Group Holdings Ltd., the island’s largest bank, recently raised the rate on its two-year fixed rate package by 0.3 percentage points to 2.75% per annum, according to The Straits Times. Other banks have already made their mortgage plans more expensive. 

One reason why potential condo buyers are still keen is skyrocketing rents. According to a Bloomberg News survey of real-estate agents, rental prices are rising 20% to 40% on average for private homes leased by expatriates. Tenants are coming back. “Foreigners have begun to, slowly but surely, return to the city as the country further relaxes safety management measures and opens its borders,” says PropertyGuru Pte., which runs a popular online property portal. That changes the buy-or-rent equation for self-occupiers even at higher mortgage interest rates; it could also bring in yield-seeking investment, or at least offset the impact of higher annual property taxes for non-owner-occupiers from 2023. (Unlike the stamp duties, the property taxes aren’t a cooling measure; their main goal is to keep a lid on wealth inequality in the financial center.)

Limited supply of new homes is also attracting buyers to new projects that are getting launched. Billionaire Kwek Leng Beng’s City Developments Ltd. and its partner MCL Land Holdings sold 77% of their jointly developed 407-unit Piccadilly Grand over one weekend in early May at an average price of S$2,150 per square foot.  

A rare Nassim Road property can afford to be pricey; Piccadilly Grand, too, sits on a location central enough to command a premium. But if like last year, the froth starts to spill over into middle-class, suburban homes, authorities will have to come in and break up the party. For now, though, they just might wait for the Fed to do the job.

But will it? Singapore’s rapid post-pandemic re-opening offers a stark contrast with arch-rival Hong Kong. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that new-home sales in the Chinese special administrative region could fall 20% this year. It’s in Hong Kong — and not Singapore — where the rising cost of capital may really come to bite. That’s because weak economic activity means lackluster rental demand. A landlord who’ll earn a rental yield of 2.2% on an investment property, and pay a floating mortgage interest rate of 2.2% — subject to a sharp increase — may as well head over to Singapore. Looks like they already are.

I've worked with some good colleagues over the years with increasing responsibilities, but unfortunately the long hours for 6 days a week started to affect my life and health outside of work. Most of my project site offices were in inconvenient locations and at one time, I was doing 2-hour commutes each way over a period of 5 years. But I stupidly stayed on because I thought as a young person, I could tahan it and it was better to be earning money instead of being at home on Saturdays where I would game and build my plastic models. I thought that that's just working life and it was the responsible thing to do as an adult.

I ended up gaining almost 20kg from stress eating and lack of exercise, my social and dating life was basically dead, I had trouble sleeping at night, and I was losing interest in things that I used to love. This in turn led me to also lose interest in my work. It's not like I had an emotional connection to it in the first place, but I started to find it meaningless and unfulfilling.

The past two years were particularly bad. Got recalled back to office immediately after circuit breaker just because they wanted to see me physically. I was sent to an office almost 2 hours away from home again. I had my pay cut in half by being ordered to go on no-pay leave for a period of time for no reason (probably punishment for something I did, my big boss has done this to others). I was asked to pack up my belongings and move out of a site office in less than half a day without having the chance to say goodbye to people I knew. This month, I was moved to an office where 5 people were expected to work inside a space the size of a shipping container. Since the start of this year, I started having thoughts of suicide just to escape work and regularly googling 'I want to die'. Felt that life was hopeless with no future except experiencing this over and over, if not at this job then at others.

I'm leaving with nothing lined up because I feel that I'm in no shape to jump immediately to another job when I'm this full of toxicity and negativity. My plan was to take a few months to rest and get back in touch with myself, but I'm worried that I've committed career suicide by generating a big red flag for future employers by becoming voluntarily unemployed, especially when I'm just shy of 40 years old.

I worked in this company for 3 years and not a single cent was raised. With 10 years of working experience, my salary is only around mid 2s. I only got a lesser and lesser workload and I eventually got bored of my job.

Anyway, when i first joined the company as a media/marketing related role, i had plenty of ideas and passion to help the company to stand out in the industry. But my ideas and suggestions were quickly turned down by my supervisor and boss. That's when i realised, they don't need my expertise, they only need my hands and legs to work the way they wanted.

A few months into the company, my boss walked to me and said ""I don't want you to be a robot, you need to be creative"". Even though there is nothing I can do at this point.

My boss and supervisor who aren't trained or studied in marketing / media chose to believe in themselves more than me. I specifically told my supervisor our company acted like an atas brand, but market like pasa malam lelong lelong. If they wanted to be branded, they have to research and see how big brands market themselves.

And in order to be ahead of the industry, we have to do something different. We have to go deep into customers perspectives. What customers wanted to see, and not what we wanted to see. They rather post on their social media ""happy new year / merry christmas / this is our top sales team"" which is so redundant because definitely customers aren't drawn to these. Moreover, they always like their own posts and acted like they are so popular.

I again suggested some ideas for a change, but was rejected again! A few years down the road, social influencers suddenly started doing what I have been telling my company to do. Instead of realising i am right all along. My supervisor told me ""xxx, see this. They do so nice. So many people watching. We should do something different from what we usually do""

At this point, I have already given up on using my brain.
Even my company started outsourcing freelancers to redo my work and I was told that I am cheap, therefore I wasn't that good TWICE by different people.

I was given work outside my jobscope and was judged by my supervisor for being ""lazy"" because my work wasn't that great. It wasn't even my strength to begin with. I merely help out due to her being overloaded with work.

Worse time to argue with my supervisor and soon its appraisal date. Instead of 100 over colleagues that I spent my 80-90% time working with, my appraisal was done by my supervisor who hardly saw me.

As soon as I joined the company, my company broke the sales record year after year. Yet my bonus shrunken. Salary remains the same.

I felt so mentally tired of doing nothing and judged for doing nothing so i decided to leave for good. 

Today i walked into my boss's office and gave him the letter with a polite smile. All i got was ""okay"" from him. I further said that in the mean time or after i leave, if the company needs any help, I am more than willing to help out. He only said thank you as i leave his office. He did not seem to be bothered by my sudden resignation or wanted me to stay.

As I was on my way home on the MRT, I got a bit curious and began to search my company to see if they were hiring. That was when I saw my company actually hiring a role that is similar to my job with a salary between 100%-160% of mine. It was posted 1 week ago.

And no, it's impossible to have an additional colleague because the fact that I already have nothing much to do. So highly likely it is to take over me in the company.

So long story short, if I never quit today, i may get fired tomorrow. I left without securing another job.

You may be asking why I didn't leave earlier. I have an adjustment disorder. Hence i don't cope well with changes. And I am actually happy to work in my role. It would just be better if i have given the trust and opportunity to do much more, given that i am the only one in the company that have the related education and experiences in marketing/media.

If you read until here, thanks for your time. My stress has just begun as now I'm going to battle my own adjustment disorder.",2022-07-05 00:06:07+08:00,20,False

> SINGAPORE - They may look similar to the button one presses to activate the green man at a traffic junction, but at two new pedestrian crossings here, a wave of the hand is all that is needed to signal an intention to cross the road.

> As part of a six-month trial by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), contactless push buttons were on Thursday (June 30) installed in Jalan Besar, near Syed Alwi Road, and Tampines Street 86, close to Block 879A.

> By the end of this month, the buttons will also be on traffic light poles at new crossings in Bukit Batok Street 32, near St Anthony's Primary School, and Yishun Street 21, near Block 219.

> Signs with pictures showing how the contactless devices work will be on the traffic light poles at the four trial locations.

> Mr Jerry Heng, LTA's deputy director for traffic, street and commuter facilities lighting, said the current push buttons can become defective due to improper use.

> Worn out buttons may not send a signal for the green man when pushed, or they may get stuck and keep sending the same green man signal to the system.

> As they age, the buttons require more maintenance and, with more than 11,000 installed at about 2,400 traffic junctions, the work can add up.

> Over the years, some buttons have also been vandalised and abused through ""repeated triggering"", Mr Heng said.

> Due to misconceptions among pedestrians that each press will make the traffic light turn in their favour quicker, this has led to wear and tear being accelerated, reducing the button's expected 15- to 20-year lifespan, he added.

> The hope is that without the mechanical button and physical contact, the new contactless devices will be more reliable and easier to upkeep - saving costs and manpower in the long run.

> The contactless buttons also minimise the transmission of Covid-19 and other diseases, with similar trials conducted over the past couple of years in Australia and Canada for this reason.

> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported in November last year that touchless pedestrian button trials in Melbourne received positive feedback, and drew interest from New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore.

> According to the ABC report, the buttons used in the trials cost A$320 (S$305) - about A$100 more than the current ones.

> Mr Heng said that to keep the costs of the trial in Singapore low, the contactless buttons being tested here are modifications of the regular ones. But LTA may come up with a new form if the trial run succeeds.

> For now, there is still a button in the middle of the new device, but it cannot be used. On the right is an infrared sensor that will detect when a pedestrian waves his hand in front of it.

> Mixed vegetable rice stall @ S Luck Eating House

> 47-year-old Ye Hualiang, who has been operating at the same coffeeshop for over two decades, told Mothership that he has maintained prices for close to 10 years.

> S$3: two meat and one veg

> S$3.50: two meat and two veg

> Apart from rice, the stall also offers noodles such as hor fun and bee hoon.

> Here is what some customers were buying:

> These two packets cost S$3.60 in total.

> These three packets of mixed veg rice, along with a separate packet which contained two servings of steamed egg, cost S$10.50 in total.

> Guo noted that there are some who have all three of their daily meals from his stall.

> SINGAPORE - When American linguists Keri Matwick and Kelsi Matwick came to Singapore in 2018, one thing that caught their eye was toilet etiquette posters featuring the use of comics.

> Dr Keri Matwick, a lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) School of Humanities, says she and her twin sister found these posters ""humorous but complex"" as they were not common in other countries.

> ""We started noticing these posters and thinking, 'Oh, this is really interesting,'"" she adds.

> They were so intrigued that they decided to analyse the use of humour in these posters, which come under the Keep Public Toilets Clean campaign.

> Their research led to a paper titled ""Comics and humour as a mode of government communication on public hygiene posters in Singapore"", which was published in the Discourse, Context & Media journal in April this year.

> The study notes that ""the choice of the comic genre as the medium of the message allows for a made-up world"", helping to make taboo topics more relatable and memorable to the public.

> In addition, the comics' ""humour and visual-verbal interplay, simple narrative plot and exaggerated characters make it possible to remind, instruct and chide without sounding overbearing"".

> Says Dr Kelsi Matwick, adjunct lecturer at the College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida: ""Research has shown that humour can improve learning, attention span and retention of a message. The brevity of comics' messages can grab viewers' attention and increase the retention of its message.""

> Most people in Singapore would have seen these posters, which are found in public toilets in places such as libraries, train stations and hawker centres, and feature comics drawn by cartoonist Lee Chee Chew of The Straits Times.

> One example is the ""Use The Hand Dryer Or Hand Towels"" poster, which shows a bespectacled man watching a fellow toilet user flick water onto the floor after washing his hands, eventually causing himself to slip and fall.

> On this comic strip, Dr Keri Matwick says: ""Both the language and semiotics of the comic work together to make it funny and instructional.""

> Adds Dr Kelsi Matwick: ""The lesson of the comic is explicit, with the line saying, for example, 'Clean public toilets are possible.'

> ""By linking the image of the hand flick to this comic, connections to discourse of social irresponsibility and disgrace are made. The underlying message is that following social rules in public washrooms is an intelligent way to act.""

This was the ""great affective divide"" period; Ngiam was far from alone in being the bureaucratic elite voicing concerns at alien technocrats chipping away at the PAP's personalised grip on the machinery of the economy via privatization. Notice that these anxieties were mainly voiced in English and spread in the domestic English-language press (which mattered back in the 1990s). 

The attack did stick in minds, which is why today we see the HDB, neighbourhood primary school, etc. backgrounds. of CCS, HSK, LW, etc. highlighted. 

However - today the PAP is not facing an opposition led by a Chinese-educated LTK and CST but with equally English-educated highly elite professional leaders, more akin the old lawyerly WP of JBJ once again. As the demographic has become more English-speaking and educated, so has Singapore's political class, both government and opposition alike. I would expect that this particular attack will no longer be as resonant in the 2020s and 2030s; instead, the anxiety will be that the PAP is now mediocre and can no longer deliver the (supposed) hypercompetent and far-sighted leadership that it has built a mythology around.

a few ministers who used to be high paid lawyers and doctors cover for the entire cabinet. most of them just career civil servants or taken from glc. this is circular logic already. anyway why do we want to hire them at such high pay. what about being a high paid lawyer or surgeon means can be a good minister? totally different skills sets.

> The singer-songwriter was named Best Female Singer (Mandarin), the fourth time she has clinched the award.

> This makes her the singer with the most wins in the category, beating three-timer winner A-mei, from Taiwan.

> She won four awards in total on Saturday - her album Depart was named Best Mandarin Album, Album of the Year and Best Vocal Album Recording.

> During her acceptance speech as Best Female Singer (Mandarin), Chua, 47, said that when she first entered the industry in the late 1990s, she knew how to sing only English songs.

> She said: ""When I tried singing Mandarin songs, I had to flip through the dictionary. At one point, I really wanted to give up.""

> Referring to her first Golden Melody Award win in 2006 - also in the Best Female Singer (Mandarin) category - she said: ""The award saved me. It reached out its hand, told me to keep singing.""

> Her Best Vocal Album Recording win on Saturday was unexpected, Chua said, given that the album - her 12th - was recorded with a guitar and a microphone amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when movement was still being restricted.

> The work reflects her thoughts on the pandemic and its impact on the way people live. Among its tracks is the song Photographs, a duet with France's former first lady and singer-model Carla Bruni.

> Almost 30 awards were given out at the 2022 ceremony, which took place at the Kaohsiung Arena, and was hosted by veteran television host Daniel Lo.

> Late Hakka musician Chiu Chen, who died on March 24 this year at the age of 72, was among the two recipients of the Special Contribution Award.

> SINGAPORE: Drivers to Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint may see a futuristic structure looming ahead, allowing them to go through contactless immigration clearance.

> Just enter the canopy, scan your passport and you'll be prompted for your facial and iris biometrics.

> Called the Automated Passenger In-Car Clearance System (APICS), it is currently being trialled at the checkpoint. It began on Jun 21 and will end in October, with authorities to announce more operational details at a later date.

> The system was developed by the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX).

> A first prototype of the system was trialled in 2017 and findings showed that self-clearance of travellers in vehicles is “feasible”, said HTX in a media factsheet.

> As part of the first prototype, laser scanners would detect the position of car windows before robotic arms would extend a cradle supporting wireless biometric devices to travellers. Those in the vehicle would then scan their thumbprints and be photographed on these devices, before returning the device to the cradle.

> The system was adjusted for the current trial.

> “Essentially, what we took away are all the robotic fixtures that require a lot of movement, a lot of moving parts and made the process (of clearing immigration) more seamless,” said Mr Cheng Wee Kiang during a media showcase of APICS. Mr Cheng is director of HTX's Robotics, Automation and Unmanned Systems Centre of Expertise.

> ""As people spent more time online, we continued to see a stream of self-radicalisation cases during the pandemic,"" he said.

> ""As we reopen our borders, there will be a surge in international travel. So there may be a renewed terrorism threat as foreign fighters return home or travel to conflict zones. There will also be more opportunities for lone-wolf attacks.""

> SINGAPORE - Some owners of flats undergoing the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) in Ang Mo Kio said they will likely take up a new rehousing option for a replacement flat on a shorter 50-year lease.

> It is one of two new rehousing options introduced on Saturday (July 2) by the Housing Board to provide more options that meet the different needs of Sers flat owners.

> Sers flat owners in Ang Mo Kio will be the first to get these options.

> Technician Ghazali Abdul Rahman, 60, told The Straits Times that the new option will allow him to move into his new flat when he is set to retire in 2027 with some cash in hand.

> He is considering a four-room replacement unit as it is just slightly smaller than his current three-room corner unit, but getting one with a 99-year lease would have left him owing an estimated $40,000 for his new home.

> Residents of Blocks 562 to 565 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 were told on Saturday that they could take a three-room or larger flat at the replacement site on a shorter 50-year lease, if the new flat is able to last the owners until they are 95.

> Alternatively, they can opt for the lease buyback scheme at the existing Sers flat if they are aged 65 and over.

> This is the first time that the HDB is offering four-room flats on a shorter lease.

> The new options come after residents had raised concerns about having to shell out as much as $100,000 in cash for similarly sized replacement units.

> Mr Ghazali, who occupies a 13th-floor unit with his wife, said he thinks the option of taking the 50-year lease is reasonable and the one which he is most likely to consider.

> Similarly, retired writer Pauline Dawn Loh, 65, said she is happy about the HDB's swift response to residents' concerns.

> She said: ""It would have been very difficult for us to bridge the gap in the prices between the old flats and the new flats.""

> Ms Loh, who lives with her husband who is also a retired writer, said the price difference between their current 82 sq m corner three-room flat and a slightly smaller 80 sq m four-room flat in the new block is estimated to be about $80,000.

> SINGAPORE - The National Day Parade (NDP) National Education (NE) Show returned on Saturday (July 2) after a break of two years, with thousands of Primary 5 pupils showing up at the Marina Bay floating platform.

> Streaming in as early as 4.30pm, the pupils screamed in delight as various elements of the parade made their appearances. Many of the children held up their phones to capture the action.

> These included aerobatic displays by F-16 fighter jets, landings by the Red Lions parachutists, and a security operations demonstration by the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team called the Total Defence Display.

> Among the Primary 5 pupils in attendance was Chai Rui Jia from Kranji Primary. The 11-year-old was looking forward to the parachutists as there was ""suspense on whether they can land in the right area"".

> It was the first time watching the parade in person for many of the pupils, including Saravanabhava Sonika and Mohamed Hafiz Mohamed Haneefa from Fengshan Primary. They are both 11.

> Hafiz told The Straits Times: ""I feel lucky to be part of the batch that is able to watch the NE Show in person, as some of my friends had to miss it in the past two years.""

> Saturday's rehearsal was the first of three NE shows to be held for the NDP, which is returning to its usual, centralised format. Organisers are aiming to fill up to 26,000 seats at the floating platform.

> Pandemic restrictions in the past two years had meant that the Aug 9 bash had to be scaled down.

> Before Saturday (July 2), the NE Show was last held in 2019.

> Highlights this year include a segment marking the contributions of national servicemen, with this year being the 55th anniversary of national service.

> The show segment - helmed by first-time creative director and theatre veteran Adrian Pang - consists of five chapters and a film. It aims to depict how Singapore battled the pandemic and emerged from it.

> In a statement, Mr Tan Kean Loong, assistant director of the Ministry of Education's Student Development Curriculum Division 1, said that the NE shows are a key cohort experience for Primary 5 pupils to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean.

> He added: ""Through this collective experience, we are also going to have a deepened appreciation of what we can do as a nation and how we can forge ahead, as a nation, in the future.""

1092,ieklcqd,t3_vpr2u9,2vx2xcyw,t3_vpr2u9,"> # 'A single hanging of a drug trafficker is a tragedy; a million deaths from drug abuse is a statistic'

> Stephen Sackur: You are Home Affairs Minister, you have been for some time, as well as being Law Minister. Singapore is very well known around the world for its, many would say, draconian criminal code, and particularly when it comes to drugs, narcotics and the bringing of drugs into Singapore - you have a mandatory death penalty for that particular crime. Do you have any doubts at all, that that is the right policy?

> Minister: I don't have any doubts. Capital punishment is one aspect of a whole series of measures that we have, to deal with the drug abuse problem. It's imposed on drug traffickers, and it's imposed because there's clear evidence that it is a serious deterrent for would-be drug traffickers. The trafficker wants to make money. He, you know, is damaging the lives of drug users, their families - damaged, often seriously destroyed. You look at the devastating impact of drugs worldwide. WHO (World Health Organisation) report 2021: 500,000 people died, linked to drug abuse, in just one year. More than 70 per cent of that was linked to opioid abuse. United States: more than 100,000 deaths due to drug overdose in the year ended April 2021. Life expectancy in the US declined for the first time in 2015 since World War I, due in large part to the opioid crisis. I don't think enough attention has been paid...

> Stephen Sackur: Let me stop you, Minister, just for a second, because you said some very important things that I just wanted to dig into a little bit. You framed the whole thing in terms of an effort to crack down on traffickers, on the big business of illegal drugs across the world. No question. It's a very serious problem. But the fact is that one of those high-profile cases that your system has dealt with in the last few months is that of an individual from Malaysia, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who was caught with the equivalent of three tablespoonfuls of heroin as he entered Singapore. He had an IQ of 69. Medical experts say that represents intellectual disability, and after more than a decade on death row, you hanged him. Does that seem proportionate and compassionate to you?

> Minister: You've got your facts wrong. The courts found that he had the workings of a criminal mind, and he made a deliberate, purposeful, calibrated, calculated decision to make money, to bring the drugs in. The psychiatrist called by the defence agreed and confirmed that he was not intellectually disabled. And last year when his final appeal was dismissed, at the same time in October 2021, the US executed two men whose lawyers argued that they were similarly intellectually disabled. They had similar IQs, same range, somewhere between 64 and 72, 63 and 95. The courts, the US Supreme Court in one instance, upheld the executions. The men knew what they were doing for those reasons. Now, I don't see the BBC...

> Stephen Sackur: Surely you should be holding yourself to a universally high standard? You are a minister who has talked about making sure that compassion is at the centre of the judicial system in Singapore. So, it's no good pointing to other countries which may have their own flaws. I'm asking you to look at this on its merits.

> Minister: On its merits, this is the point I will make. This is a man who brought in drugs, in order to make money. He had the workings of a criminal mind. His own psychiatrist confirmed that he was not intellectually disabled.

> And look at the context: we are talking about saving lives. What do I mean? In the 1990s, we were arresting about 6,000 people per year. Thirty years later today, there are more drugs around the region. Singapore is wealthier. Afghanistan and Myanmar are among the largest producers of drugs in the world. We are a logistics centre. We would be completely swamped. The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) said that this place is swimming in meth and a record haul of one billion meth tablets were seized in South-east Asia. We are in that situation.

> Stephen Sackur: I believe I'm right in saying, minister, you have about 60 people on death row at the moment, don't you, and the vast majority of them we know are convicted of drug offences?

> Minister: We do, but we have also saved thousands of lives. Because we are now arresting about 3,000 people per year. That's 3,000 people...

> Stephen Sackur: The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network says Singapore's international reputation has deteriorated significantly as the result of things like the execution of this individual, Nagaenthran. That's what you have to confront. Are you prepared to see your state's reputation sink because of the draconian decisions you insist on making?

> Minister: I think the key thing is the lives of Singaporeans and protecting Singaporeans. You know, people focus on, and the BBC focuses on, this one person. You ran four articles (on this case) from October of last year to March of this year. One of them was the headline, overtaking the Ukraine war. But you haven't run any article on what the UNODC said about the severe situation in South-east Asia. And what about the thousands of lives that are at stake from drug trafficking? You know, we're not even talking about Mexico.

> Before we move on, let me just make this point, Mr Sackur. I think the media reporting and all the things that you've quoted, make this point - that a single hanging of a drug trafficker, to misquote a well-known quote - a single hanging of a drug trafficker is a tragedy; a million deaths from drug abuse is a statistic. I think that's what this shows.

> This comes as the nation is facing a serious dengue situation. Close to 18,000 cases have been reported so far this year, over three times the 5,258 cases last year.

> In the first half of this year, about 389,000 dengue inspections were conducted islandwide, with the National Environment Agency (NEA) uncovering about 10,800 mosquito breeding habitats.

> A total of 1,173 cases were reported in the week from June 19 to 25, NEA said.

> ""Although the numbers in recent weeks have shown a decline, the risk of transmission remains high as there are still more than 300 dengue clusters across the island. The weekly number of cases is still very high, exceeding 1,000 cases, and we are in the early months of the traditional peak dengue season in Singapore,"" NEA said.

> As the nation ramps up its fight against dengue, some 5,000 volunteers from the PA grassroots organisations and PA Community Emergency Response Team (Cert) will join NEA's SG Clean Ambassadors in conducting house visits in dengue cluster areas over the next two weeks.

> They will be sharing information and tips with residents on how to prevent mosquito breeding and how to better protect themselves.

> These complement ongoing house and ground inspections by NEA officers.

> On Saturday (July 2), Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng joined PA volunteers visiting homes at Boon Lay Drive to urge residents to remove stagnant water and potential mosquito breeding habitats, as well as take proactive measures to prevent dengue cases in the neighbourhood.

> Boon Lay is an active dengue cluster area.

> Mr Baey also thanked the volunteers for their support in ramping up dengue prevention awareness to stem the surge in dengue cases.
