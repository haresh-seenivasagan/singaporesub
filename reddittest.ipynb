       "  'When some redditors lowkey made fun of undertones in my [original guide](https://medium.com/@fureifurei/beyond-uniqlo-a-step-by-step-style-guide-for-sg-dudes-2e84f37e32eb), I chuckled in real-life. Because a rough draft of this post was in the back of my mind already.\\n\\n**Why bother with colours?**\\n\\nSimple - Just look around the mrt cabin. Almost everyone is in a neutral-coloured outfit, and our Mondays can hardly be any bluer. This means the bar is really quite low. So, once you pick an outfit in a colour that suits you, you\\'ll immediately look like you have character. \\n\\nI\\'d even say it\\'s the easiest and most affordable option available, if you want to stand out. For example, if you want to stand out through the texture and quality of your clothes, you\\'ll easily need to spend 3x and up. Not ideal if spending more than [$50 for a T-shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vkw2o6/comment/idwev6p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is not for you.\\n\\nThe other thing is, if you go to any image consult that includes fashion advice, you\\'ll likely go through the colours for you bit. That\\'s how important it is. Just look at our dear Prime Minister LHL, there\\'s a good reason why he wears pinks and light blues. (You\\'ll learn why by the end of this post.)\\n\\n# Level 0 - I hate colours\\n\\nSome people like wearing only neutrals for various reasons, including:\\n\\n* Ease of dressing up\\n* Colour-blindness\\n* \"I work in a very serious industry\" \\n* \"I want to be taken seriously\"\\n* \"I like the aesthetic\"\\n* \"I really have no money bruh\"\\n\\nThat\\'s ok, you do you. Come back next week when we talk about Chino Shorts.🙂  \\n\\n\\n## Level 1 - Is there a TLDR version?\\n\\nOf course! Only 2 steps are required.\\n\\n* Go figure out if you\\'re [warm or cool undertoned](https://medium.com/@fureifurei/beyond-uniqlo-a-step-by-step-style-guide-for-sg-dudes-2e84f37e32eb). Then only buy and keep clothes that are in the corresponding set of neutrals+blue [here](https://imgur.com/HDv87iT).\\n* Buy a set of accessories (shoes, bag, cap, watch, etc) that are in your favourite colour. Bonus points if they match your undertone, and if you buy some tops in that colour too.\\n\\n## Level 2 - For the people who are willing to do a tiny bit more\\n\\nIf you feel the need to be somewhat in trend (or you don\\'t have a favourite colour), do this optional step: Once a year, in early December, find out the [Pantone Colour of the Year](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2022) for next year. Then buy a new set of accessories in that colour. You can also try that colour out with one t-shirt.  \\n\\n\\n### Huh? What is the Pantone Colour of the Year?\\n\\nPantone provides a colour-matching and standardisation system for a wide number of industries. Basically, any respectable designer or OEM manufacturer from any country will have a Pantone chart. That\\'s how you can make sure your vendor in, say, Shenzhen (China) is seeing the exact same shade of blue as you in Singapore.\\n\\nSo, they run annual meetings/debates for color experts; based on this, they declare a so-called internationally recognised Colour of the Year. (Plus a set of complementary colour palettes.)This matters because designers all around the world will look at this, and take it into consideration.\\n\\nWhichever the case, you will likely find the colour readily available in the upcoming year. ***Making it easier to buy items/accessories that are in the same colour across many brands.*** (YEAH. This tip will make your life easier.)  \\n\\n\\n### Eh, the Pantone colour this year really doesn\\'t suit me leh. How siah?\\n\\nThree options:\\n\\n* Don\\'t buy that colour. (Duh. Don\\'t waste money on what you don\\'t actually enjoy!)\\n* Stick with bags/shoes only. (Not too close to your face, so much more forgiving.)\\n* Look at the Pantone palette or the year\\'s Spring/Summer [Fashion Report](https://www.pantone.com/articles/fashion-color-trend-report). Then pick a colour that you like. (This is based on the London and New York Fashion Weeks. There\\'s no better place to copy homework alr, k?)\\n\\nNow, if all you want is that little 10% bump in style, you can stop here and move on with your day. It will be enough for many people. For the people who are willing to dive deeper...  \\n\\n\\n## Level 3 - There are 12 Seasons, not 4.\\n\\nUsually, stylists/image consultants will go through personal colour analysis if you pay them. \\n\\nIf your parents did this exercise in their youth, the stylist will help them fit into one of these [4 colour seasons](https://imgur.com/7sxkXJT): Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter\\n\\nSince then, it has evolved into 12 seasons. Probably because the original 4 didn\\'t have enough precision, people often look better with specific subsections of each season. For example, imagine a field of sunflowers vs a carribean beach. The colours of each scene is different, but they are both summer.\\n\\n  \\n**Without further ado, here are your** [**12 seasons**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFFU3FrTLY/hiYii0AlplcS6Ch_M4-8qQ/watch?utm_content=DAFFU3FrTLY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)**!**  (Click the link for the tool.)\\n\\n  \\n**That\\'s A LOT of seasons. How do I know which one am I?**\\n\\nThe mindless and fun way to do it - Just place your finger/arm across the screen and swipe through these 12 frames till you find the one that looks right on you! (Do this exercise under natural sunlight, if possible.)\\n\\n  \\n**The more systematic way**\\n\\nFirst, answer these questions:\\n\\n* What is your skin\\'s undertone?\\n   * A) Warm\\n   * B) Cool\\n* How light is the colour of your hair?\\n   * A) Light Brown, Blond, White (Light to medium)\\n   * B) Brown to Dark Brown (Medium)\\n   * C) Black\\n* How fair/dark is your skin?\\n   * A) Fair (Caucasian, Northen Asian...)\\n   * B) Average (South East Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American...)\\n   * C) Dark (South Indian, African...)\\n\\nAAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, ACA - >!Spring!<\\n\\nBAA, BAB, BBA, BBB - >!Summer!<\\n\\nAAC, ABC, ACB, ACC - >!Autumn!<\\n\\nBBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC - >!Winter!<\\n\\n  \\nThen compare 3 types of each season, and see which one suits you best. Then screenshot it for your next shopping trip! That\\'s all. :)  \\n\\n\\n### Some questions/points that cropped up when I was studying this:\\n\\n* Does the fairness or darkness of my skin decide my season?\\n   * Not really. It\\'s mostly the warmth/coolness of your tone, the overall feel of your skin, plus contrast between your skin and your features.\\n* I can\\'t tell what my undertone is! (Even though I have tried the gold vs silver test.)\\n   * It probably means that you\\'re neutral-skinned person, so try:\\n      * Fair-skinned: Light Spring, Light Summer, Bright Spring, Soft Summer\\n      * Medium-skinned:  Bright Spring, Soft Summer, Soft Autumn, Bright Winter\\n      * Dark Skinned: Soft Autumn, Bright Winter, Dark Autumn, Dark Winter\\n* My skin is olive-toned.\\n   * Try: Soft Autumn and Soft Summer\\n* Why does LHL wear pink?\\n   * Coz he\\'s got white hair. So, combined with his warm-toned skin, he\\'s now solidly a Light Spring. Which is why light blue suits him too. The [oxblood brown shirt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL0l_gbCMPE) he wore for the 2004 National Day Rally will probably look horrid on him now. On a similar note, this is also why older Indian men often look so good in white. (YES. AGE CAN CHANGE YOUR SEASONAL COLOUR.)\\n\\n# What\\'s next:\\n\\n* Stay tuned for the medium edition of this post. Due to formatting challenges and sheer number of supporting images needed, I can only include the descriptions + finer details for each season there. Feel free to [follow me on Medium](https://medium.com/@fureifurei) if you want to be notified instantly on Tuesday.\\n* Apply, apply, apply. It takes a lot of practice to wear colours with finesse. As some of you may know, there are complementary colors, contrasting colours... Feel free to look it up and study how to apply.\\n* A final tip: It can look like you\\'re trying too hard if everything you wear is too coordinated. So, if you notice that, all you gotta do is swap one small item on you out for another. (Such as socks or your watch.)',\n",

       "  \"This is a totally random question, but I'd like to know if anybody is interested to explain.\\n\\nTo give context, I used to live in Singapore for study and work back during 2007-2012. Stayed mostly in city center (Bugis, Clarke Quay, Orchard, City Hall etc). And at the time I left SG, I could hardly find any Anglo-Euro-foreigners/expats walking around the streets of Singapore. Even in drinking hotspots, they're not that easy to look for.\\n\\nThen came 2015 or so. I came back for a holiday to SG and was totally shocked to see the number of Anglo-Euro-foreigners have dramatically increased in the city center. It's like I can hardly walk down the streets without seeing at least a dozen of them in sight.\\n\\nI hope I don't sound racist, but I am genuinely curious. Why was this happening? Was there any sort of drastic change of foreign policies or something of that nature that stimulated a significant increase of Anglo/Euro foreigners in general?\",\n",

Living in the UK is very stable but chances are you are going to have an incredibly average life.\\n\\nOn paper, Singapore seems like a great option. As I understand it pretty much everybody speaks English and it's used as the primary language in most professional settings? \\n\\nA beautiful country, one of if not the cleanest country in the world with incredibly low crime rates and great education opportunities.\\n\\nI have a few concerns that I'm hoping you guys can answer though!\\n\\nHow in general are foreigners treated in Singapore?  Our plan would be to make a life there and obviously this would play an important part in how things went.\\n\\nHow likely are foreigners to get low-ish skilled jobs? I work as a stock controller in a warehouse which generally doesn't need qualifications as such, but prior experience in similar roles. My partner works in customer service.\\n\\nI understand the majority of people live in high rise buildings, are regular houses incredibly expensive? We would definitely rather live in a house or maybe a small block of flats with garden access.\\n\\nWe currently have a mortgage and if we were to sell our house we would have around £50,000 (84,978 singapore dollar), although we are debating not selling our house and just renting it for about £700 (1189 singapore dollar) a month. Would the sale of our home be a decent deposit to one day buy a house there? If we were to rent would 1189 be a good additional income along with our jobs?\\n\\nWould you say it's a requirement to learn Malay? We have absolutely no problem learning another language but if there is basically nobody who regularly speaks Malay then we would of course make it less of a priority.\\n\\nAnything else you think we should know?\\n\\nThanks for any advice\",\n",

This post is all over the place as the subject matter jumps around a lot, but there\\'s too much content in here for the daily thread.*\\n\\n1: **What do you think are the most powerful ministerial portfolios and why?**\\n\\nI don\\'t see this question being bandied about a lot. While in certain areas it may seem obvious, I may be surprised. If possible, name your top 4.\\n\\nBecause I love to categorize things, I\\'ve also included my personal categorization of our Cabinet ministers by power and influence.\\n\\n|*Tier*|*Ministr(ies)*|*Current minister(s)*|*Notes*|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|***\"You don\\'t CB me, I\\'m the PM\"***|Prime Minister\\'s Office (PMO)|Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister|Of course he\\'s at the top LOL|\\n|***\"Respect your Seniors\"***|Anywhere the PM tells you (usually 80-90% of everything)|Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister/Coordinating Minister for National Security; Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister/Coordinating Minister for Social Policies|Also, Tharman is still [chairman of MAS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Board-of-Directors) so he is still DPM Lawrence\\'s boss in at least one place. SM position gives them symbolic authority, CM gives them the power|\\n|***\"You either won at life for 4G or you lost, GG\"***|Your ministry + anywhere the PM tells you, except when the Seniors sabo you|Lawrence Wong, DPM and Finance Minister (PM-in-waiting), Heng Swee Keat, DPM and CM for Economic Policies|One won, one lost because his East Coast Plan needs him AHAHHAHAHHAHAHA (for real though: good luck for your future HSK)|\\n|**The Big Five (Finance, Defence, Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Law)**|Your ministry. If you in cabinet for 100 yrs you get to stick finger everywhere else if PM lets you|Ng Eng Hen, Defence; K. Shanmugam, Home Affairs/Law; Vivian Balakrishnan, Foreign Affairs|These five pillars are the bedrock of administrating the company that is Singapore. If I really had to abolish all but five ministries in emergency, would keep these ones|\\n|**Cabinet Geylang, the Hurdle. Don\\'t F up. Or you F\\'ed up anyway. Come, I clap for you**|Your ministry. Don\\'t F up, the public looking liao|S. Iswaran, Transport; Chan Chun Sing, Education; Ong Ye Kung, Health; Desmond Lee, National Development (bc HDB)|Contribute to our society the most but also give the most headaches, if you get bad PR you lose. People here now are probably 4G\\'s DPM candidates. Or F\\'d up and are stuck here forever.|\\n|***\"Recruit/private, don\\'t disappoint PM\"***|Your ministry. Work hard ah, then we helicopter you|Grace Fu, Environment; Masagos Zulkifli, Social and Family Development; Josephine Teo, Communications; Indranee Rajah, PMO; Maliki Osman, PMO; Edwin Tong, Culture; Tan See Leng, Manpower|Entry-level ministers, ministers not yet in a fight for DPM, or minister who hentak kaki forever (*cough cough JoTeo).* Often on first or second ministerial portfolio.|\\n\\n2: **What do you think about two-position Ministers who have to commute between HQs in one day?**\\n\\n[I watched this video of K. Shanmugam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6vNQhY-sYw) a while back, and thought about something. Some replies to my previous question ask how ministers do so many jobs at once. K. Shanmugam has to commute between MHA headquarters in [New Phoenix Park](https://www.mha.gov.sg/contact-us) *and* the Law Ministry at [High Street](https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ministries/minlaw), presumably every day. How about ministers like Maliki Osman, who\\'s Second Minister for two ministries (MOE and MFA)? Do they have to commute between three HQs and split their mind every day?\\n\\n3: **Why Second Ministers and not Deputy Ministers?**\\n\\nI\\'ve answered similar queries with my own thoughts before, but now I ask the rest. Why use the term \"Second Minister\", for someone who\\'s already a Minister for another ministry, rather than a separate \"Deputy Minister\"? The term \"Second Minister\" implies a second, competing boss at the Ministry all the time.\\n\\n4: **Who could be Deputy Prime Minister, Senior Minister, or Coordinating Minister(s) in a Lawrence Wong cabinet?**\\n\\n[PM Lee mentions that Lawrence Wong will pick his deputy \"in due course\"](https://mothership.sg/2022/04/dpm-choice-by-lawrence-wong/). After the whole debate about the next PM, now we should move to who LW will pick as a deputy prime minister. Will he pick one, or two? Who? Will the new DPM(s) also head a ministry at the same time? Which ministry?\\n\\nAs for Senior Ministers, highly doubt TCH and Tharman will stay for Wong\\'s full tenure. Assuming Lawrence fills these posts as PM (they\\'ve been vacant for long stretches before), who do you think will be selected? Why? And who will succeed TCH, Tharman and HSK and Coordinating Ministers for National Security, Social Policies and Economic Policies respectively?\\n\\nEDIT: We call MOT the Defence Against the Dark Arts portfolio, what about the other Hogwarts subjects?',\n",

(Details are in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/vflwq8/beyond_uniqlo_a_stepbystep_style_guide_for_sg/).)Thank you, everyone here in r/SG, for the awards, upvotes, and shares.\\n\\nSo, onwards to the topic of the week - **White T-shirts!**\\n\\n## Wait, whut, why?!\\n\\n* Everyone needs a white tee, and it\\'s the foundation of every wardrobe.\\n   * For those of you who really hate white tees, you can apply the same tips but opt for greys, blacks, or off-whites. That said, it\\'s still highly recommended that you have at least one, as it\\'s the easiest to coordinate.\\n* I wanted to give y\\'all a sense of how far the rabbit hole can go.\\n* You will understand why choosing colour may be the easier option. Here\\'s an analogy. You know how the simpler the dish, the better the ingredients and the cooking techniques need to be. Well, the white tee is the white rice of your wardrobe. Welcome to rice-cooking 101!\\n\\nThere are many types of T-shirts - [Polo tees](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/polo-shirt_1028307.htm), [Raglan tees](https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/young-handsome-man-wearing-white-grey-raglan-t-shirt_9680484.htm), [Henley tees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_shirt), etc... For various combinations of collars, lengths, and fit. There are something like 10+ styles. We\\'ll focus on the most **basic classic white tee** and the **oversized white tee**, because the other variants can have very specific requirements for the wearer\\'s build.\\n\\nHow do you decide which of these two to wear? Look at your body shape.\\n\\n## The 5 classic body shapes\\n\\nReference Image:  [https://imgur.com/0B2GJgb](https://imgur.com/0B2GJgb)\\n\\nThe shapes are based on the relative proportions of your body. Usually, you\\'ll be able to tell by looking at yourself (naked) in the mirror. But you should measure to be sure.\\n\\nMeasure the circumference of your shoulder, chest, waist and hips with a measuring tape. **Which of these apply?**\\n\\n1. Is your hip the broadest? Is your waist thicker than your shoulder by at least 3cm? >!You\\'re a Triangle. (Aka Pear shaped)!<\\n2. Is your waist at least 3cm thicker than your hip and shoulder? >!You\\'re an Oval. (Aka Apple shaped)!<\\n3. Are all 4 measurements within 3cm of each other? (Especially the waist vs chest.) >!You\\'re a Rectangle.!<\\n4. Is your waist the slimmest?\\n\\n* Yes, and your shoulders are more than 5cm thicker than your hips. >!You\\'re an Inverted Triangle.!<\\n* Yes, but your shoulders are less than 5cm thicker than your hips. >!You\\'re a Trapezoid.!<\\n\\n**Note:**\\n\\n* There are more detailed models for body shapes, but this basic guide will suffice for now. I\\'ll do a deep dive into silhouettes later on.\\n* Traditionally, stylists will make recommendations that sculpt you into that masculine, inverted triangle shape. Depending on your body shape, it can add up to a lot of work and/or solutions that aren\\'t viable for everyday comfort. Thus, I\\'ve modified some of the recommendations here to encourage more diversity and comfort.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n||Basic|Oversized|Remarks|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Triangle 🔺|x||You will want a standard fit, not too tight. HOWEVER - If you see an oversized tee with a little bit of shoulder padding or structure, PLEASE AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY. It may unlock a whole new world for you.|\\n|Inverted Triangle 🔻|x||Yeah, you have the ultra-masculine build, especially if you work out. Try Raglan tees too, especially if you find the sleeve-armpit area of standard tees constricting. Unless you\\'re REALLY toned, go for a normal-to-slim fit.; NOT skin-tight fit. EXCEPTION: If you\\'re broad-shouldered BUT thin, you can give Oversized tees with softer fabrics a try.|\\n|Trapezoid|x|x|Congratulations, you have the classic average build. Means you can try both. If you\\'re a bit toned, or have a compact build, go for the basic. If you\\'re not toned, or want a more bookish/\"herbivorous\" aesthetic, go with the oversized.|\\n|Oval||x|The fabric should be of moderate stiffness. (Should not be too thin, otherwise, it will cling to your contours too closely.) Resist the urge to go for overly baggy clothes, and the sleeve should NOT go beyond your elbow. Work with a tailor if you have to.|\\n|Rectangle|x|?|You CAN try both options. BUT. You have a slim/compact/long build, you can differentiate yourself by rocking that lean beanpole look. Especially if you are long-limbed too.|\\n\\n**Who else should try Basic:** People who work out regularly (Shape is secondary here; you worked hard to build that muscle tone.)\\n\\n**Who else should try Oversized:** People who have sloped shoulders (Yes, this is for keyboard warriors with shitty postures.)\\n\\n## Time for a case study\\n\\nIntroducing my favourite ~~muse-cum-model~~ guinea pig u/Echlori!\\n\\nSome basic info:\\n\\n* 177cm, 70-72kg, Trapezoid build\\n* His \"imperfections\" include: Slight belly, sloped shoulder, not much muscle tone, roughly 5:5 torso/leg ratio, poorly defined jawline... (\\\\*eyeroll\\\\* The beauty standards really last warning ah.)\\n\\nPhoto:  [https://imgur.com/KFpiGuY](https://imgur.com/KFpiGuY)\\n\\nA: Classic fugly polo tee. Literally, everything looks better in comparison. It even gave my guinea pig moobs!!! (Note: There are EXCELLENT polo tees. But writing a guide on it will need another 1000 words from me and a lot of legwork from you. So, let\\'s skip? LOL)\\n\\nB: Not the right tee for him due to the cutting; even the S size didn\\'t align right with his shoulders. But people with broader shoulders (Inverted Triangle or Trapezoid build) can try.\\n\\nC: Overall cutting looks good. But the pocket is a few mm away from perfection, and he didn\\'t like the skin feel of the fabric. Otherwise, the base silhouette is better than option D.\\n\\nD: The fabric wasn\\'t comfortable either. The cutting also didn\\'t do anything for his belly, and the overall shape visually adds 10 kg to his body.\\n\\nE: Looks like option D, doesn\\'t it? Nope, it ain\\'t. Coz the fabric is softer and thinner. Combined with the slightly too-oversized cut, he looks ready for bed.\\n\\nF: I had to photoshop this one to censor his nipples. A classic example of a fabric that is extremely comfortable for sports but too clingy for polite company. Can consider getting a dark/coloured version of it.\\n\\n**G: He bought** [**this one**](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E452399-000?colorCode=COL00)**.** Because the shirt had shoulder seams that align with his shoulders, had the right thickness for SG, and the fabric had the right level of stiffness. Didn\\'t quite pass the scrunch test, but we can\\'t expect perfection at $14.90, right?\\n\\n## Considerations, and better options for certain body features\\n\\n* For most people, pick tees with moderately soft/stiff fabrics. If the fabric is too stiff, it\\'ll create a boxy effect. Too soft, it\\'ll show off all your curves. (Yes, including your durian baby.)\\n* Slip your hand under the shirt. If you can see the contours through one layer of fabric, don\\'t buy. It\\'s definitely too thin and/or too soft. (Unless you want to show off your nipples?)\\n* Try more than one size. (Usually, it\\'s up instead of down.) Why: When sizing changes, the dimensions don\\'t always change in the same/proportionate amount! Sometimes, you will be pleasantly surprised if you size up.\\n* Choose a standard V-neck collar (NOT a deep V, thank you) or wider collars, if you have broad shoulders and/or thick/short necks\\n* Try Raglan tees if you have really broad/juicy shoulders.\\n* For people with narrow shoulders (Triangle shape people especially), try a smaller collar, or the Henley collar. Also, feel the seam that connects the collar to the sleeve. (The one that runs along your shoulders.) If it feels stiffer or is reinforced, PLEASE TRY IT.\\n\\nAt this point, you have learned enough to pick out a decent white tee. Combined with the simple colour test in [my previous guide](https://medium.com/@fureifurei/beyond-uniqlo-a-step-by-step-style-guide-for-sg-dudes-2e84f37e32eb), you can now pick out suitable colour tees too. Hop off if you wish.🙂\\n\\nNow, for the perfectionists here...\\n\\n## \"White\" is not white\\n\\nLet\\'s do an exercise together right now.\\n\\nLook up from your screen, and pay REALLY close attention to where your home\\'s walls meet the ceiling. Nope. It\\'s not your imagination. For most of us, the whites will be different. Because painters usually use a default white paint that is ideal for ceilings, which is an actually-white white. While your walls can be any of these: [https://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/design/reno-tips/reno-tips-choosing-the-right-shade-of-white/](https://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/design/reno-tips/reno-tips-choosing-the-right-shade-of-white/)\\n\\nBonus off-topic tip - If you\\'re ever unsure about which white to choose for your home\\'s walls, I wholeheartedly recommend Nippon Paint\\'s Lily White (1137). Why? It gives a subtle touch of warmth, goes well with wood furniture, and it ages gracefully. (Yeah, the colour of your wall will gradually change over the years, due to the environment.)\\n\\n**Now back to white t-shirts!**\\n\\nJust like wall paints, the whites of t-shirts can be subtly different. (You can gather all the white tees in your home and compare.)\\n\\nLook at option G in the case study. The colour is strangely coherent with him, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nNow look at option F. You will notice that there\\'s just something slightly jarring about that white. That\\'s because option F is a cool white, while my dear guinea pig is clearly warm-toned.\\n\\n**Liddat how?**\\n\\nLuckily for you, you live in Singapore. Meaning you can choose slightly thinner and breathable fabrics. This means they are VERY slightly translucent, and will subtly blend with your skin tone. **So, just pick white fabrics that suit our climate and it usually won\\'t be too bad.**\\n\\nThere is, however, a limit to this \"cheat\". Plus, if you choose thicker or more opaque fabrics, the coolness/warmth of the white will be EVEN more obvious. i.e. when you pick white shirts.(Those of you who had white school uniforms, remember how some first-year students just look weird? YUP. A lot of times, it\\'s because the white doesn\\'t suit their skin.)\\n\\n**Wanna learn how to choose your whites and off-whites?** Stick around for my next article, which will dive deep into colours. After that, I\\'ll continue with guides for these basics: Chino Shorts, Jeans, White shirt, Blazers, Pants.\\n\\n## Closing remarks\\n\\n* **Your \"white tee\" does not literally have to be a white tee.** Mark Zuckerberg\\'s white tee is a grey tee. Steve Jobs\\' white tee was Issey Miyake\\'s Semi-Dull black mock turtleneck (\\\\~SGD350 per piece). Mine is currently a $10 black padded shoulder tee from a fast fashion brand that I won\\'t mention. (It\\'s not 100 marks to me, and I\\'d like to support a more sustainable/responsible company. So yeah, I\\'m questing for an upgrade too.) Did I mention that there are different types of black too? LOL\\n* It may take you a while to find your perfect white tee, but I promise you it\\'s a quest worth doing. The next time you get dragged out shopping, stop by the men\\'s section and check out the white tees. You may or may not buy it, but over time, you\\'ll develop a sense of what suits you.

       "  ' \\n\\nA long time ago, in a Southern Province of China…\\n\\nMy first memories of Singapore were of the show Under One Roof. There weren’t a lot of English TV options back then, and something about the dysfunctional but loving Tan family resonated with me, a lonely kid in a far off province of his own. Sure, we had little in common - I, ten years old, an American, not knowing his dim sum from his durian, they using exotic words like kiasu and Mee Rebus. But something about the love the family had for each other, the patience and forgiveness with their foibles, the idea that no matter what happened in that half hour, everything would work out ok - that resonated with me.\\n\\nOver the next ten years, I came to learn that the show represented everything there is to love about Singapore. The love for family, the inherent safety of existing in a country that provides for its people, the celebration of diversity, the kindness and generosity of its people - this is what I came to discover in my time there. And despite being an Ang Mo, despite despising Rojak and Otah Otah, Singapore has stolen my heart and will hold it forever.\\n\\nMy formative years were spent in what would be shocking levels of independence here in the States - romping through Lower Pierce Reservoir, riding my bike to the arcade in Yishun, playing capture the flag on Mt. Faber long before it had a cable car. Singapore gave me the freedom to be a child in safety. Later, she gave me the foundational experiences of a young man, falling in love while sitting on the rooftop of the Esplanade, watching what stars we could see through the city lights. She gave me my first heartbreak when that love moved away, and distance took its toll. She gave me friendship like I’ve never known since, forged playing Counter Strike in $5 LAN cafes, and street soccer matches in the HDB void deck, and long days watching the tankers float by off the East Coast. She taught me that Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus can live in mutual respect and understanding, and that whatever differences might exist between us are far outweighed by our shared experiences as people. She taught me to be a responsible adolescent with a healthy respect for the law and for my fellow citizens, and to show mad respect to Auntie when she yells at me for kicking a ball into her yard. She taught me, through the ever changing Expat communities, how to make new friends fast, and how to say see you later without saying goodbye. She taught me empathy, patience, and forgiveness, all through the people I met in the hawker center, or on the MRT, or down my street. In short, she made me the person I am today. And it is why I keep coming back, year after year, even though circumstances have kept me from living there full time, which will always be my dream. It’s why I will always see Singapore as my true home. \\n\\nI know Singapore isn’t perfect. The ugly tendrils of the world’s culture wars have begun to seep in - frustration with the trajectory of the society,  a lack of faith in social and governmental systems, and most disturbingly, racial tension. And I recognize there is a tendency to focus on the negatives - I see it plenty on this forum- and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Without criticism, there can’t be growth. But at the same time, I’ve felt that Singapore sometimes has a sort of insecurity to it, that because it is small, it has to constantly change and innovate, to be bigger, shinier, more glamorous, more competitive, more….more. But you are enough now. You are a model of what so many places could and should be. You are not your casinos or your rooftop bars, but your values and your people. And you are beautiful.\\n\\nUnder One Roof might be long gone, but the sense of place it evoked remains. And I hope to return and remain some day as well. Love to you all.',\n",

       "  'Hi XXX (name withheld)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe spoke last evening about our thoughts on the repeal of 377A. You said that if you had to vote on this issue you would vote not to repeal 377A based on the moral guidance of your Christian faith. I was dismayed, and as I mulled over your justifications later that evening, and even today, my feeling shifted from dismay to perturbed. Yes, I am perturbed if that is your reason. Let me explain why.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. The Christian faith as in all religions, preaches many things. Some are universally good, some are simply untenable in today’s world - I mean, the Bible does say a lot about rights to own slaves, divorce and (the lack of) women’s rights. So are you consistent enough to rely on your faith when it comes to every issue put on a vote, or do you conveniently single out certain beliefs from your faith to suit your own bias and perceptions?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2. It is precisely your faith that opposes and oppresses the LGBTQ community at large. One just need to observe comments and motivations made within the faith community to understand the constant onslaught of discrimination and threats against the LGBTQ family. So by relying on your moral conscience to your faith to make a decision that continues to oppress and make unequal a gay person’s standing in his society, have you abandoned your moral conscience of many others (amongst which are your constituents as well) to strive for a more equal society? As I reiterated last night, we are not taking away rights from  the heteronormative society, there is nothing they lose by us gaining a bit of dignity in our lives.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n3. I stand by what I said last night that an MP elected by his constituents should be representing the voice of his constituency instead of being guided by his personal beliefs. Otherwise, why bother even having Meet The People sessions? The whole point of the MPS is for the MP to listen, understand the ground and grievances of the constituents, and represent their voices in parliament. I completely understand that one issue can have many voices and opposing opinions. Then I feel as an MP, his vote should always be - always be - to be on the side of the disenfranchised. I have presented to you enough reasons why the LGBTQ community is constantly at a disadvantage and losing end of so many other laws and regulations that support a heteronormative family that typing them all down here just overwhelms me negatively even further. How much real and tangible disadvantages will the conservatives incur on the other hand, from a repeal of a law that although isn’t enforced legally, is being wielded by them “because it is still there” to justify their continual discrimination? None. But they do get less intangible weight when imposing their belief system on others.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLastly, my example of the analogy of a wealthy MP voting against the appeal from his poorer constituents to raise taxes for the rich because he is reluctant to lose his wealth is very real and relevant. You said “But who would do that?” Yet this is happening around the world, even in Singapore. I believe an opposition party wrote this - “We will continue to argue against the proposed GST increase in parliament, as well as for alternative forms of revenue generation, such as wealth taxes…”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHave a think about what I have put down here. Again, I sincerely appeal to you to listen to the LGBTQ voices on the ground to have a better understanding of the real struggles they face in their daily lives, and the lament of the potential they could have achieved if they were given a little more equality.',\n",

       "  \"I do film photography as a hobby. I'll be traveling to Malaysia by bus and decided to bring my camera and some rolls along to document the sites. From what I've read, the carry-on luggage scanners shouldn't do too much to ISO 200-400 film and I've also seen that some people request for a hand-check by the security officers rather than bringing them through the scanners. Are these possible at SG and JB customs (specifically the ones at the Causeway)? Or are there any other things to take note of?\\n\\n\\nP.S Hello to anyone finding this post in the future. I've returned from my trip and guess I'd share what the experience was like. Basically very smooth and simple. I carried my film and camera with me in its own bag and it was just a matter of taking them out of the bag before it entered the scanner and explaining that I had photographic film. Customs on both sides were accommodating and simply waved me through once I told them about it. Only difference between SG and Malaysia is that SG has a metal detector and pat-down whereas Malaysia does not, but it didn't affect anything about the film. All of this is as of June 2022.\",\n",

       "  ' \\n\\nSINGAPORE - A migrant worker who was active in local literary circles and founded two community groups here has left Singapore after his work permit expired and was not renewed.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday (June 22), Mr Zakir Hossain Khokan, 43, said the system had initially reflected an \"adverse record with a government agency\".\\n\\nHe was later told that this was an administrative error and that his work permit was \"ineligible\" for renewal, he said.\\n\\nResponding to media queries, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said it takes into account various factors when assessing an applicant\\'s suitability to work in Singapore and for work passes to be renewed.\\n\\nThe ministry noted that by Mr Zakir\\'s own account, Singapore has allowed him to work here for 19 years.\\n\\n\"Through his time in Singapore, he has written often about migrant workers here. We renewed his work pass many times despite his activism and writings,\" said MOM.\\n\\n \"We draw the line, however, when public posts are misleading, false or deliberately provocative.\"   \\n\\n\\n\"It cited a Facebook post that Mr Zakir made last October in the wake of unrest at Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory that drew riot police to the scene.\\n\\nPolice had responded to a call for assistance at the dorm after a confrontation between workers and management over poor quality food and long delays in transporting workers with Covid-19 to recovery and healthcare facilities.\\n\\nWhile Special Operations Command officers were on standby, the Ministry of Home Affairs said then that additional police units were not deployed and no arrests were made by the police durting the incident.\\n\\nMOM said Mr Zakir had called migrant workers in Singapore \"work slaves\", and dormitories here \"work camps\", and also alleged that soldiers and armoured vehicles had surrounded the dorm.\\n\\n\"This was a false characterisation,\" MOM said. \"There were no soldiers, let alone armoured vehicles, around.\"\\n\\nThe ministry added that Mr Zakir\\'s statements could have incited migrant workers at the dorm and elsewhere, inflamed their emotions and possibly caused incidents of public disorder.\\n\\nIt added: \"The ability of a foreigner to work in Singapore is not an entitlement. Mr Zakir has been permitted to work in Singapore for a long time, though he was a long-time activist.\\n\\n\"His work pass has since expired. He cannot prolong his stay when he no longer has a job in Singapore. He has over-stayed his welcome.\"\\n\\nThe ministry also noted that while Mr Zakir had appealed the decision by the Controller of Work Passes that his work pass was ineligible for renewal, his employer did not appeal. The appeal was considered and MOM informed him that it was unsuccessful.\\n\\nA former freelance journalist and poet, Mr Zakir returned to his home in Bangladesh on June 15 after working in Singapore\\'s construction sector for nearly two decades.\\n\\nDuring his time here, he founded literary interest group Migrant Writers of Singapore and started \"One Bag, One Book\", a book-sharing project for foreign workers here that later helped to distribute supplies to migrant workers living in dorms when Covid-19 struck.\\n\\nMr Zakir took the first prize for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 in the Migrant Worker Poetry Competition organised by Banglar Kantha, a newspaper here for the Bangladeshi community.\\n\\nMr Zakir said in his Facebook post that he received notice from his employer\\'s human resources department on May 24 that his work permit could not be renewed.\\n\\n\"I went to my site office and realised that I couldn\\'t access the building. I called my HR and they told me that my work permit could not be renewed,\" he told ST\\n\\nMr Zakir, who declined to name the employer, added: \"It was so sudden and unexpected.\"\\n\\nAppeals made on his behalf by several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals, including MP Louis Ng and former NMP Anthea Ong, were not successful. This is according to a letter seen by The Straits Times that was sent to Manpower Minister Tan See Leng requesting a closed-door meeting to seek clarifications.\\n\\nMs Ong, who met Mr Zakir five years ago at a community event by her social enterprise Hush TeaBar, told ST that he had approached her for help after he got news that his work pass was not being renewed.\\n\\nShe asked him to appeal directly to MOM and also agreed to write a letter to Dr Tan to outline Mr Zakir\\'s contributions to the migrant worker community.\\n\\nMs Ong said she asked for the reasons why Mr Zakir\\'s work permit was not renewed but MOM did not give one.\\n\\nShe noted that MOM has been doing good work in engaging NGOs and migrant workers since it set up a new division called the Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group in 2020 to care for migrant workers here.\\n\\n\"I hope this matter will not affect ACE\\'s efforts nor discourage our migrant brothers and sisters from coming forward to volunteer or create initiatives to support fellow migrant workers,\" said Ms Ong.\\n\\n [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrant-worker-advocate-who-did-not-get-work-pass-renewed-made-misleading-false-public-posts-mom](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrant-worker-advocate-who-did-not-get-work-pass-renewed-made-misleading-false-public-posts-mom)',\n",
